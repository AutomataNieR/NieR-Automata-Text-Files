But at the same time, we're NOT them. We're NOT the same.
We are who we are, and that Devola and Popola were who they were.<bt_wait>
That's how I felt when I saw Devola being hurt.
                                        I wanted to shout it at everyone.
                                                                      I wanted to scream.<bt_wait>
As far as I'm concerned, there's only one Devola.
And for her, there's only one me.
No one can take the other's place.

      Rain
           falls 
                 from
                      the
                          sky.<bt_wait>

It stimulates our sensation nerves like cold needles.<bt_wait>

We need maintenance badly. But that's a pipe dream, I suppose.
No android would dare help a pair of outcasts like us.
</page>

<page>
<i>Are you cold, Devola?</i><bt_wait>
<i>I'm all right as long as you're with me, Sis.</i><bt_wait>
<i>I feel the same.</i><bt_wait>

We press our bodies together to try and retain heat.
It's cold now. So cold. Much worse that the searing heat of midday.
But we just smile at each other and keep pressing on.<bt_wait>

There's another camp on the other side of the desert. A new camp.
If we can just get there, I can finally fix Devola's leg.
</page>

<page>
And yet, I wonder if there's anywhere on this planet that will take us.<bt_wait>

<i>Hey. What's wrong?</i><bt_wait>

<i>...It's nothing. Don't worry about it.</i><bt_wait>

I do what I can to suppress the anxiety building in my chest.
And I keep walking.
</page>

<page>
The rain grows worse. It lashes at us without pause.<bt_wait>
Is this our punishment?<bt_wait>

I reach out and...
<sele_AME>touch Devola's cheek.
<sele_KARADA>support Devola's body.
</page>

<label_AME>
<page>
The rain flows down her cheeks like tears. I reach over and gently wipe it away.
She smiles, but seems surprised.<bt_wait>

<i>There's no point in doing that,</i> she whispers.<bt_wait>

But there is.
Because I swore to myself that I would stay with her forever.<bt_wait>
Forever.
</page>
<go_SABAKU_END>

<label_KARADA>
<page>
As long as we have bodies to support one another...
As long as I have someone with whom to share my fate...
Then I will press on, no matter what happens to me.<bt_wait>

Because I won't ever stop protecting her.<bt_wait>

I won't stop.<bt_wait>

No one stops.
</page>
<go_SABAKU_END>

<label_SABAKU_END>
<page>





For that is the fate we twin androids have been assigned.
