a2: What the...?
pod042: Analysis: YoRHa unit A2 was restarted five minutes and forty-two seconds ago.
pod042: The cause was excessive strain due to battle against a large machine lifeform.
a2: All this goddamn sand is starting to piss me off.
pod042: Alert: Fuel filter performance deteriorating.
pod042: Fine particulate matter seems to have entered the filter while fighting in the desert.
pod042: Proposal: Replace the faulty part immediately.
a2: You make it sound so easy.
pod042: Records indicate said part was once used at the Resistance camp.
a2: The Resistance camp...
pod042: It is located at—
a2: I know where it is.
toolshop: You need a fuel filter? Sorry, but I'm all out!
toolshop: You'll have to ask Anemone when new stock is going to arrive.
kj: A fuel filter? I'm a weapons trader, what are you asking me for!?
kj: Try the supply trader.
bs: You need a fuel filter? Why don't you ask the supply trader over there?
a2: Hey, Anemone. Got a question for you.
a2: Any chance you could spare a fuel filter?
ane: A fuel filter? I'm afraid our supply recently ran out.
ane: Pascal makes them for us, so you could go pick up one directly if you'd like.
a2: Pascal!?
ane: You know him?
a2: You TRADE with the enemy!?
ane: His village is different. They've never caused us any harm.
a2: No way. Forget it.
ane: This may be hard to understand, but we forged an alliance and trade materials when the need arises.
ane: We can't be picky about how we reach our goals around here.
ane: And besides, we aren't so far gone that we kill machine lifeforms after they surrender.
a2: ......
pod042: Alert: A broken filter will cause significant problems with fuel distribution.
pod042: Proposal: Replace the faulty part immediately.
a2: Yeah. I know.
pod042: Coordinates confirmed for a colony centered around the machine lifeform known as Pascal.
pod042: Location marked on map.
a2: You don't know when to shut up, do you...

spider: Net...work...
spider: An...droids...
a2: Is this thing SERIOUSLY still kicking!?
pod042: Speculation: It is driven by remaining data located within enemy servers.
a2: So this just keeps going until I kill 'em all!?
spider: We...we are...
spider: Bonds...are lost.
spider: Someone... This hole...
spider: Fill in this hole...
a2: This is messed up.
a2: What the hell is this thing going on about?
pod042: Analysis: It appears to be a leak of the enemy's past memories.
spider: I believed you, I believed you, I beLIEved you...
spider: Become a god, become a god, become a god, who has become?
spider: Take their... Take their lives... Take their...
spider: Become as gods!
spider: As gods! As gods! ...as gods!
spider: Lose what is precious...
spider: Lost...destroyed...
spider: So we destroy you too...
spider: Look...at the stars...
spider: Sing...a song...
spider: Dedicate...now...
spider: We are machines.
spider: We are machines.
spider: You are androids.
spider: You are androids.
spider: Mutual enemies.
spider: Doomed to fight.
spider: Why do you live?
spider: Why do we exist?
spider: I see...light.
spider: The light.
spider: We will soar through the sky.
a2: What's all this junk?
pod042: Speculation: It is a resource of some kind.
a2: Used to make what?
pod042: Unknown.

a9s: Now they're just messing with us...
a9s: There's something written here, too...
pod153: Analysis: Access to elevator control system blocked by external factor.
pod153: It reads "soul box."
pod153: Proposal: Hack into devices blocking elevator controls.
a9s: ...No enemies?
a9s: What's this?
a9s: Oh, I get it.
pod153: Analysis: There are two blocking devices on this floor.
a9s: I have to break the system protection before I can reach the core.
pod153: Proposal: Hack into all blocking devices.
a9s: Huh. So that's how it works.
pod153: Analysis: There are three blocking devices on this floor.
a9s: That huge structure is some kind of launch platform.
a9s: Yeah, and I hack into all of 'em, right?
a9s: A structure that size could probably shoot something into space pretty easily.
pod153: All elevator controls unlocked.
a9s: ......
pod153: Proposal: Investigate the next area.
a9s: So this is some kind of cannon aimed at the human server on the moon?
pod153: Hypothesis: This area should be investigated in order to meet the mission objective.
pod153: Insufficient data. Cannot confirm or deny.
announce: We have a special present for you—a token of appreciation for all the machine lifeform requests you completed!
a9s: Damn it!
