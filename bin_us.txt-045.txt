a9s: Gotcha.
op210: "Gotcha" is not an approved form of radio engagement, 9S. Operator 21O out.
op60: Operator 6O to 2B.
op60: Looks like you found all the necessary parts to improve our network environment. Nice work!
op60: You can conclude your mission by bringing everything over to Anemone.
op210: Operator 21O to 9S.
op60: I've confirmed that you have the necessary parts to improve our network environment.
op60: Take the materials to Anemone in the Resistance camp. Operator 21O out.
ane: I heard about this from the Bunker.
ane: These are the parts we need for our network structure, right? Thanks for bringing them over.
ane: It's not much, but I have a reward for you. Oh, but don't tell the Commander—it's probably against regulations.
a2b: 2B to Operator 6O. Material handover complete.
op60: Copy that. Good work!
a9s: I see the Commander's as much of a slave driver as ever.
a9s: It's like she was built to be as efficient and hard-assed as possible.
op60: Aw, she's not so bad.
a9s: Are you serious?
op60: Totally serious! The Commander actually lets a lot of things slide on the side.
op60: Like, did you know that she leaves piles of clothes strewn everywhere? The cleaning team is SO sick of it.
op60: Oh, and she never performs regular maintenance on herself.
op60: A lot of the "hard-ass" nature you mention is just for show.
a2b: How do you know all this?
op60: Hee hee! I can't tell you that...
op60: Operator 6O out.
a9s: What the heck was all that about?
pod042: Target location data obtained. Marking on map.
pod153: Target location data obtained. Marking on map.
ane: How's it going? You hanging in there?
[[quest\q162\q162_fc7da4a2_scp.bin]]
op60: Thanks in advance for investigating that access point that went dark.
op60: Operator 6O to 2B. Come in, 2B.
a2b: 2B here.
op60: The monitoring signal from the new access point has gone silent.
op60: I'm sending you the positional data. Please investigate the site as soon as possible.
a2b: Understood.
a9s: We've got company. Looks like machines.
pod042: Alert: Jamming signals detected from enemy units.
a2b: Yeah?
a9s: That's not good.
pod042: Enemy machine lifeforms eliminated. Access point returned to functioning status.
cmd: Bunker to 2B.
cmd: The signal from the access point just came back online. Good job.
a2b: I have some information about that, Commander.
cmd: Go on.
a2b: The access point went offline because machine lifeforms were jamming it.
cmd: Which means they know that facility is one of our network terminals...
a9s: Yeah, but that's not all. While they knew it was connected to our network, they didn't try to destroy it.
a9s: It's almost like they were trying to lay a trap.
cmd: Damn... They're getting smarter by the day.
cmd: Thank you. I'll be sure to share this with the Council of Humanity on the moon.
a2b: Understood.
[[quest\q170\q170_96333b78_scp.bin]]
op60: Thanks in advance for handling that transporter repair.
op60: Operator 6O to 2B. Come in, 2B.
a2b: I read you, Operator. Go ahead.
op60: It looks like the transporter we installed in the city ruins has gone offline.
op60: Our surface activity is going to be severely limited until we get it fixed.
op60: Can you head over there and get it working again when you have a sec?
a2b: Will do.
op60: Thanks, 2B! Sending the details now.
pod042: Analysis: Non-functioning transporters can result in serious limitations to data uploading and other vital mission activities.
pod042: Recommend repairing transporter as quickly as possible.
a2b: Understood.
pod042: Alert: Hostile machine lifeforms detected in the vicinity of the non-functioning transporter. Jamming signals detected.
pod042: Hypothesis: Transporter malfunction is due to enemy jamming signals.
pod042: Proposal: Unit 2B should destroy the enemy machines.
a2b: Is that all of them?
a2b: Let's check this thing out.
a2b: I don't see any damage.
pod042: Analysis: Transporter is now operational.
a2b: This is YoRHa unit 2B. Connect me to Bunker Operator 6O.
op60: Oh, hello, 2B! Operator 6O here.
a2b: The transporter was being jammed by machine lifeforms. It should be working now.
op60: Looks green on my end, 2B. Nice work!
op60: I'll let Command know right away.
op60: I'll also be sending over a little reward for all your hard work.
a2b: Roger.
op60: You know, 2B? I'm a little jealous.
op60: Don't get me wrong—I know all this fighting isn't easy for you.
op60: But you get to see all these new and amazing things out there...
op60: It just...it might be nice to visit the surface sometime, you know? That's all.
a2b: I see.
op60: Er, right. Apologies for the unnecessary chatter.
op60: Anyway. Operator 6O out!
pod042: Report: Mail notification received from access point.
[[quest\q171\q171_12f2963a_scp.bin]]
a2b: Pod?
pod042: Understood.
a2b: I didn't say anything yet.
pod042: The conversation between Operator 6O and unit 2B has been analyzed.
pod042: Hypothesis: Unit 2B wishes to send Operator 6O a gift from the surface so that she might be able to experience it in some fashion.
a2b: ...That's right.
pod042: Proposal: The gift should be a photograph of a rare flower.
a2b: You think?
pod042: Analysis of historical data indicates that human females enjoyed viewing the reproductive organs of flowering plants.
pod042: If unit 2B can procure appropriate image data, it could be uploaded to the Bunker.
pod042: Proposal: Unit 2B should obtain an image of the plant known as the "desert rose."
a2b: All right.
a2b: Pod, take a photograph of the desert rose and send it to Operator 6O.
pod042: Affirmative.
