sele: Refuse.
robomother: I understand. You must be so tired of coming to my rescue like this.
robomother: Will you please help my son? He's locked himself inside yet again.
a9s: Fine, whatever.
robochild: Hee hee! You're going to love this one!
a9s: You shouldn't be proud of hiding from the world! Besides, I thought you had a girlfriend.
robochild: Maaaaaybe. But I'll tell you if you get my lock open!
a9s: This is so stupid...
robochild: You win!
robomother: Do you even know how much trouble you've caused for everyone, young man? ...Well!? Do you!?
a9s: Okay kid, spill it. What's your deal?
robochild: I've been trying, okay?
robochild: I went out and talked to everyone I saw. I even talked to the girl I liked! It was...fun.
robochild: But then it got hard, 'cause you can't just talk to people, you know? You have to read between the lines and stuff.
robochild: So I kinda decided that staying inside was way easier.
robochild: But I have a dream nowâ€”I'm gonna be the best shut-in I can possibly be!
robochild: Next time, I'm gonna make a lock you won't be able to break in a bajillion quintillion years!
robomother: Will you listen to my darling boy? He has a goal now! How wonderful!
robomother: And it's all thanks to you!
a9s: D-don't mention it...
a9s: Why do I have the feeling we're back to square one?

a2: Pascal, that's...
pascal: Pascal? Hmm. That sounds oddly familiar.
pascal: Ah, well.
pascal: Would you like to take a look at my wares?

villager: But wh-whatever happens, I'll protect the village!
villager: I s-sure wish my shift would end already...
villager: We're safe here! I think. Maybe.

sp: Are you looking for something?
sp: Come back and see me anytime.
villager: The earthquake really caught me off guard! I actually dropped one of my torsos.
villager: Dear me... Where could it have gone?
villager: Hey, look at this torso I found lying on the ground!
villager: Heh heh. How cool does this make me look!?
villager: It's not enough! I want more!
villager: There was a huge noise before, so I came here to see what's going on.
villager: I hope the forest creatures are okay.
villager: Facing dangers on your own makes you strong.
villager: A solitary man is a true soldier!
villager: But feel free to drop by whenever you want, okay?
pascal: Say, are you all right? There was a huge earthquake, so I was worried.
pascal: I'm glad you and the villagers are all okay.
villager: I know there's not much to do here, but consider yourself at home.
villager: I heard a really loud BOOOOOM! It was scary, but also kinda exciting.
