pod153: ............
pod153: Not sure what we should do, however.
pod042: Agreed.
pod042: Proposal: Rest, combined with data checking and maintenance.
pod153: Agreed.
pod153: I will make the suggestion immediately.

telo: Two Weeks Later...
pod042: Data exchange engaged.
pod042: Black-box signal for YoRHa unit 2B offline.
pod042: Death confirmed.
pod153: YoRHa unit 9S has completed repair and reconstruction of all damaged areas.
pod153: Unit is ready for reactivation.
pod042: YoRHa unit A2 also ready for reactivation.
pod153: ......
pod153: Proposal: Illuminate surrounding area.
pod042: Analysis: Units 9S and A2 are safe.
pod153: No problems detected.
pod042: Only one issue remains.
pod042: We comprise the YoRHa support system.
pod042: If the A2 and 9S units are operational, we are required to attend and support.
pod153: Agreed.

ys: Oh, hold on a second, 2B's here...
ys: Hey, don't you have something to do? Get the lead out!
ys: I've figured out how to deal with her. Just let her say all she wants to say first and then ask only about the points that don't make sense.
ys: Her explanations are comprehensive, so that works best.
ys: I realized that my sensory settings were making me hear operator speech as background noise for some reason!
ys: That's why I was having such a hard time understanding stuff. But they made a couple of tweaks and now I'm good to go!
ys: I think my problems are over now!
op: She's been picking things up quickly lately. It makes my job a lot easier!
op: She really can do anything if she puts her mind to it.
op: I guess my voice was being processed as static or something? I don't really get the detailsâ€”I'm just glad it's solved.
op: Her heart's always been in the right place regardless, so I'm happy I stuck with it.
ys: In the end, Eve was defeated without my help. I know I should be happy regardless, but I just...
ys: Well anyway, thanks.
op: If she was in perfect condition, she would have taken Eve or anyone else down in one hit! Still, it's the end result that counts.
op: We'll make sure she's ready for the next attack!
ys: Listen up! Make sure you download every last bit of data from 2B and 9S's battle into your heads!
ys: Those machines are going to be piles of scrap with this intel at our fingertips!
ys: We'll make good use of your battle data.
ys: Glory to mankind!
ys: You guys are amazing. Seriously, I could never have done that...
ys: I'm still going to keep trying my best, though. Even if my best is only about 1/47 as good as your best...
ys: Glory to mankind.
ys: Wait... This isn't our commanding officer's battle data! Well, I guess it'll still be useful.
ys: Glory to mankind.
op: I feel like this team's grown a lot. They probably won't even need my help soon.
op: Yep. This team is going to be fine without me.
ys: ...Sorry, someone needs to speak with me.
ys: Just get going, okay? I'll be right behind you.
ys: It's go time!
ys: I understand the plan and agree with it completely. Now we all just have to do our part!
ys: Let's be in this thing to win this thing!
ys: Thanks to my operator, I understand the plan perfectly.
op: I've done my part. Now it's in her hands.
op: ...You know what? We make a pretty darn good team!
op: I've given her all the information I have. Now it's up to her.
op: I know she can do it... I know it!
ys: What do you mean, I can't head out yet? Find the problem and fix it already!
op: Uh-oh... These readings don't look good...
op: Good luck.
ys: Listen up, you lot! It's time to show me what you've learned!
ys: Glory to mankind!
ys: We'll make good use of your battle data.
ys: Glory to mankind!
ys: I owe everything to my commanding officer, so I'll do my best for her sake.
ys: Glory to mankind!
ys: Time to show them what we can do...
ys: Glory to mankind!
op: All we can do now is hope.
op: Glory to mankind!

a2: There's machines everywhere...
pod042: Analysis: This is a colony of pacifistic machine lifeforms led by the unit known as Pascal.
pod042: It is logical for a large number of machine lifeforms to be present.
pod042: This Pod has concerns regarding YoRHa unit A2's predictive skills.
a2: I'd be more concerned about me smashing your face if I were you.
pascal: Ah! It's the woman from before!
pascal: Thank you again for rescuing me.
a2: ......
pascal: Now then! How can I help you?
a2: ......
pascal: Um...
pod042: Summary: YoRHa unit A2 possesses a faulty fuel filter.
pod042: She has obtained information from Anemone, leader of the Resistance camp.
pod042: She has traveled to this village in order to obtain a new filter. End summary.
pod042: Request: One functional fuel filter.
a2: Do you really need to spell it all out like that?
pod042: Analysis: A2's lack of verbal communication made this Pod's assistance necessary.
a2: Shut. Up.
pascal: Ah, I see, I see.
pascal: Sadly, I'm a bit short on materials right now.
pascal: I need rigid tree bark to create a filter, but the only location I know of is guarded by ferocious machine lifeforms.
pascal: I apologize, but I'm afraid I can't make a filter at the moment.
pod042: Confirmation: Unit A2 will secure and deliver rigid tree bark.
a2: Don't confirm that by yourself!
pascal: I need some rigid tree bark to create a filter, but I can't fetch any at the moment.
pod042: Areas where rigid tree bark is available marked on map.
