a2: I think I know a way...
pod042: The idea under consideration is not recommended.
pod042: This Pod is a YoRHa Tactical Support Unit.
pod042: As such, it cannot approve of actions that would damage its supported unit.
a2: You're not so bad, Pod. You know that?

a2: Who are you?
pod042: Tactical Support Unit Pod 042.
pod042: This Pod has been tasked with providing firing support for YoRHa unit A2.
a2: I didn't ask for help.
pod042: Affirmative. No request was received from unit A2.
pod042: Rather, it was the final order from this Pod's previous support assignment, unit 2B.
a2: Well, it's unnecessary.
pod042: YoRHa unit A2 lacks the authority to override this order.
a2: Whatever.
a2: What the hell is that huge thing?
pod042: Unknown.
a2: You're pretty useless, you know that?
pod042: Proposal: Unit A2 should state her intentions.
a2: Why the hell would I do that?
pod042: In order to provide optimal support, Pods must be supplied with data relating to the activities of supported units.
a2: Not happening.
pod042: Proposal: Unit A2 should state her intentions.
a2: What did I just say?
pod042: If an attending support unit is not provided with data related to the activity of its target,
pod042: it is programmed to automatically repeat the request every 30 seconds until such data is made available.
a2: Are you kidding me?
pod042: Proposal: Unit A2 should state her intentions.
pod042: Needlessly repeating conversations on the same topic is a waste of energy resources.
a2: You're the one who keeps talking!
pod042: Thirty seconds have passed.
pod042: Proposal: Unit A2 should state her intentions.
a2: Damn it, stop!
a2: My intention is to beat the hell out of every god damn machine I can find! Is that enough for you!?
pod042: Affirmative.
pod042: Scanning and marking of nearby machine lifeforms complete.
pod042: Goliath-class enemies detected in desert area.
pod042: Proposal: Goliath-class enemies should be destroyed.
a2: Don't tell me what to do.
pod042: Pods are not authorized to issue commands.
pod042: Proposals are merely recommendations based on data provided by unit A2.
pod042: Proposal: Unit A2 should state updated intentions in order to secure more usable data.
a2: Shut...the hell...up.
pod042: Negative. This Pod is engaging in activity based on the final order of unit 2B.
pod042: YoRHa unit A2 lacks the authority to issue commands.
a2: Look, just stay out of my way.
pod042: Affirmative.
