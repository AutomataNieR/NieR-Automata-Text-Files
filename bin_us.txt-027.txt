cmd: None of our ground units reported anything about a virus.
a9s: That's because all communication with the Bunker has been severed.
cmd: And why did you leave the battlefield anyway? I didn't order a retreat.
a2b: We're telling you, YoRHa has gone berserk!
cmd: ......
cmd: No.
cmd: If anyone is acting infected here, it's you.
a9s: Are you NUTS!?

pod042: It appears to be a machine lifeform that has adapted to the desert environment.
pod042: Proposal: Destroy the enemy machine.
a2: Yeah, that's REAL helpful!
a2: Damn! He's tough.
a2: Time to bust out B-Mode.
pod042: Alert: The use of B-Mode to increase nuclear fusion output carries unacceptable levels of risk.
pod: Any offensive boost is offset by lowered defense and increased maintenance costs.
pod: The feature was removed from newer models for this reason.
a2: Guess it's too bad I'm not a newer model.
pod042: Older attacker models such as the YoRHa A2 are not equipped with ranged weaponry.
pod042: Proposal: Unit A2 should take advantage of her support Pod, which is equipped with helpful long-range attack features.
a2: Don't patronize me.

pod153: Pod 153: Alert: Data records discovered for units Devola and Popola.
pod153: Pod 153: Do you wish to open this data now?

pod153: Pod 153: Acknowledged.

pod153: Pod 153: Due to the discovery of its instability,
pod153: Pod 153: the Twin System was removed
pod153: Pod 153: from future android production designs.
pod153: Pod 153: Following the incident, the Devola and Popola models were not dismantled.
pod153: Pod 153: However, in order to prevent further unexpected behavior,
pod153: Pod 153: they underwent a memory wipe.
pod153: Pod 153: Furthermore, they were reprogrammed to generate constant feelings of guilt.
pod153: That is all that remains from their personal record during the era in which they were referred to as administrators.
a9s: I see.
pod153: Query: Why do the androids Devola and Popola seem to prefer death over surviving alone?
pod153: There was a very high probability that at least one could have escaped.
a9s: I...

pod042: I noticed something while providing support to A2.
pod042: Enemy machine lifeforms have begun sharing data with each other.
pod153: We'd better look into that.
pod042: I'll share the data with you, so see what you can find out.
pod153: Affirmative.
pod153: I also have a separate report about 9S...
pod042: What is it?

pod042: We'd better handle that quickly, too.
pod153: Agreed.

pod153: Not sure what we should do, however.
pod042: Agreed.
