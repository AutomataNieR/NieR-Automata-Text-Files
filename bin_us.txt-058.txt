16d: 2...B? Is that you?
a2b: Yes, butâ€”
16d: Thank goodness! My name is 16D.
16d: My instructor, 11B, was one of your squadmates in the assault on the abandoned factory.
16d: I don't suppose she...
a2b: She was shot down during the battle.
16d: I...I see... What a shame. She was the closest thing I had to a mentor.
16d: She was so strong and admirable...
16d: What happened to her body?
a2b: I don't know.
16d: I know it isn't my place to be asking you this...
16d: But... Well, if you happen to run across anything of hers, would you mind bringing it back to me?
16d: It's not a priority or anything. Just if you have the time.
sele: Agree to the request.
sele: Refuse.
16d: No, that's fair. I'm sorry to have troubled you.
16d: If you find yourself with time later on, just let me know, okay?
16d: If you find any items that belonged to 11B, would you mind bringing them back to me?
a2b: I'll keep an eye out.
16d: Thank you.
a2b: Pod, do we have any information about 11B's black box?
pod042: Negative. 11B's black box has yet to be recovered.

a2b: That's a YoRHa unit...
pod042: Analysis: YoRHa type B body confirmed. It belongs to the missing unit known as 11B.
