a2b: Protecting unit 9S while he hacks the system!
pod042: The enemy is connected to a vast network.
pod042: Analysis: The actions of unit 9S have an unacceptably low probability of success.
pod042: Proposal: Unit 2B should abandon unit 9S and save—
a2b: Shut up!
a2b: If 9S says he can do it, then he will!
pod042: Enemy unit cut off from network functionality.

a9s: Those were the words I heard in the moon server.
a9s: But why...?
pod153: Alert: 2B has defeated the Goliath-class heavy-weapon unit.
a9s: Hm? Ah, right.
a9s: Okay, good.
cmd: 9S.
a9s: Commander?
cmd: I'm sorry. You're needed back at Command.
a9s: ...Understood.
cmd: ......
cmd: You left quite a trail when you accessed the main server.
a9s: That's what I wanted to speak with you about, Commander.
cmd: ......
a9s: I found records stating that the Council of Humanity was established as part of Project YoRHa.
a9s: But I'd always heard it was the other way around.
a9s: So did YoRHa actually create the Council of Humanity?
cmd: ......
cmd: Yes.
cmd: We installed the Council of Humanity's server on the surface of the moon.
a9s: But that means...
cmd: Mankind no longer exists.
a9s: !!
cmd: In truth, humans never went to the moon at all.
cmd: Any transmissions received from the moon are just dummy signals we set up in advance.
cmd: The only thing there is a small bit of data relating to the human genome.
a9s: But why would you—
cmd: Humans were already extinct when the aliens attacked.
cmd: All the details are stored on this memory chip.
cmd: If you want to look at it, I won't stop you.
a9s: Wait, you're just giving me this? But why?
cmd: ......
cmd: No one fights without a reason.
cmd: And we need a god worth dying for.

a2b: 9S, why did you ask Pascal about A2?
a9s: Huh?
a2b: It's not recommended to interface with machines without consulting Command.
a9s: Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.
a2b: Though I suppose such intense curiosity can be admirable... In its own way.
a9s: Heh.
a9s: Thanks, 2B.
a2b: Still, machines are the enemy. Don't forget it.
ane: Oh, 2B! Your timing is impeccable.
ane: Our android forces currently have a carrier deployed in the Pacific Ocean.
ane: It should be back here to resupply before too long.
