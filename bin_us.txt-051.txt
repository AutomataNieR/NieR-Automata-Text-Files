a9s: It's a Lunar Tear. I'd better tell Emil.
eml: Hey there! What's up?
a9s: I found a Luna—
eml: I'M ON MY WAY!
eml: Sorry to keep you!
a9s: As speedy as always, I see.
eml: ......
eml: Oh. That's right.
a9s: What happened here, Emil?
eml: I was fighting the aliens. It...wasn't going well.
eml: So I decided to create multiple versions of myself to help with the fight.
eml: But the aliens just kept coming.
eml: I lost so many friends that day... It was a long time ago, but still.
a9s: Say, Emil?
a9s: How old are you, anyway?
eml: I'm not sure. I didn't need that memory to fight.
eml: Thank you for finding this.
eml: You'll let me know if you find any more, right?
eml: ......
eml: I'm gonna...stay here for a bit.
eml: ......
a9s: I should probably tell Emil about this Lunar Te—
eml: Sorry to keep you!
a9s: I didn't even contact you yet!
eml: ...
eml: ......
a9s: Emil? Are you okay?
eml: I just remembered...
eml: I...
a9s: Hmm?
eml: ......
eml: Thank you for finding this.
eml: Let me know if you find any more.
eml: ......
eml: I'm going to...stay here for a bit.
eml: ......
eml: Thank you again. You've helped me remember an important place.
a9s: Oh?
eml: A place very special to him...
eml: In thanks, I'll tell you how to visit it. Please take this key.
a9s: What's it for?
eml: It'll let you access the elevator in the shopping mall.
eml: You should head there whenever you have the time.
eml: I'm sorry. I need to stay here for a while. You go on ahead.

a2b: What an odd flower...
a9s: That's a peculiar little flower...
a2: What a weird flower...
a9s: ...
a9s: This is a Lunar Tear, right?
a9s: We'd better let Emil know.
eml: Hey there, guys! What's up?
a9s: We found a Lunar Tear. It's located at—
eml: STAY RIGHT THERE! I'm coming!
a9s: Uh...okay? I hope he doesn't expect me to just stand here all da—
eml: Sorry to keep you!
a9s: GYAAA!
eml: Oh, hey... Now that I think about it, this whole area was once...
a2b: Are you remembering something?
eml: It's all pretty fuzzy, but I seem to have a memory of caring for this flower a long time ago...
eml: But the sand kept expanding, and the flowers gradually wilted.
eml: Now that I think about it, that was around the same time I stopped seeing people.
a9s: You mean humans?
eml: Thanks a bunch for finding this. Really.
eml: Oh, and let me know if you find any more, okay?
eml: I'm gonna...stay here for a bit.
eml: ......
a9s: It's a Lunar Tear. I'd better tell Emil.
eml: Hey there! What's going on?
a9s: I found one of those flowers you were looking for. It's over at—
eml: DON'T MOVE AN INCH! I'm coming!
a9s: Don't move? I'm actually kind of bus—
eml: Sorry to keep you!
a9s: Damn, you're fast!
eml: ......
eml: That's it. I remember now...
eml: Back when the aliens first invaded...
eml: I fought as hard as I could to save Earth.
a9s: You did?
eml: I think...I had something I wanted to protect. Something really precious to me.
eml: But I don't know what it was.
a2b: ......
