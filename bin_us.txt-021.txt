a9s: Ha ha ha...ha ha ha hah!
a9s: So what?
a9s: None of it matters.
a9s: Or didn't you know?
a9s: We aren't required in this world anymore.
a9s: Humanity is extinct.
a9s: That moon server you're so worried about was invented to give us androids something to fight for.
a9s: And YoRHa was created to perpetuate the lie.
a9s: But in order to make sure no one ever learned the truth, we were DESIGNED to be killed.
a9s: They built a back door in the Bunker and programmed it to activate after a certain amount of time.
a9s: The Commander? Me? 2B?
a9s: Sacrificial lambs. All of us.
a9s: Isn't that HILARIOUS!? Doesn't it make you LAUGH!?
a2: 9S, weâ€”
a9s: Shut up!
a9s: You killed 2B.
a9s: That's all we need to kill each other.
a2: ......
a2: 2B hated to keep killing you.
a2: It caused her so much pain.
a9s: ......
a2: The 9S type is a high-end model. They knew you'd discover the truth eventually.
a2: But the model designation "2B" was just a cover.

pod042: Proposal: Gather additional data.
a2: Someday I need to teach you how to be helpful.

a2: Who are you?
pod042: Tactical Support Unit Pod 042.
pod042: This Pod has been tasked with providing firing support for YoRHa unit A2.
a2: I didn't ask for help.
pod042: Affirmative. No request was received from unit A2.
pod042: Rather, it was the final order from this Pod's previous support assignment, unit 2B.
a2: Well, it's unnecessary.
pod042: YoRHa unit A2 lacks the authority to override this order.
