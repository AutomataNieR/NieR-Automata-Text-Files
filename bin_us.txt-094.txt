a2: No.
eml: Well, I live deep, deep underground. Picture something deep, then go DEEPER!
eml: Feel free to visit me anytime you want!
eml: Boy, the world's really going to hell in a handbasket, isn't it?
eml: I actually had a bandit break into my place a little while ago!
eml: After that, I put all my valuables in a secure container. Now I don't have to worry anymore!
eml: Owowowow...
eml: Oh! Heya!
eml: Can I help you with anything?
eml: Come again!
eml: Hope to see you again!
eml: Welcome!
eml: Hello!
eml: Er, welcome?
eml: Thank you!
eml: Thank you?
eml: Sorry about that. I didn't see you there.
eml: Sorry? Do you need something?
eml: You don't have to whack someone in the face to get their attention, you know?
eml: Ow! Owowowowowwww...
eml: Hey! I remember you from the other day!
eml: Sorry I got startled and ran away. ...Er, or rolled away, I guess.
eml: Anyway, my name's Emil, and this is my shop.
eml: Wanna buy something? I've got the best prices anywhere!
eml: Urgh...  Ow ow ow.
eml: You could've just asked me to stop, you know?
eml: Hey... You're A2, aren't you?
eml: It must be fate that we ran into each other. ...And since you're here, you might as well buy something!
eml: Oh! Welcome!
eml: ...Hmm? Why am I running a shop like this?
eml: Yeaaaah, that's a really long story that we probably don't have time for.
eml: So how about you buy something instead?
eml: Thanks much!
eml: And what name should I put on the receipt?
eml: That's not necessary.
eml: ...YoRHa brain scan complete. "2B," is it?
eml: Hope to see you again soon, 2B!
eml: ......
eml: Um, I don't really think I need a receipt.
eml: ...YoRHa brain scan complete. "9S," is it?
eml: Oooo-kay?
eml: Welcome!
eml: I think you're...A2, right?
eml: How did you know that?
eml: Oh, I just remembered something 2B said. Do you know 2B?
eml: She...
eml: She's beautiful! And kind! And unusually calm, all things considered.
eml: ......
eml: What's wrong?
eml: Nothing. I'm sure she's doing well...wherever she is.
eml: I think so too. I hope you'll visit me again, A2!

eng: I am tired. I must rest.
eng: Hello, androids.
eng: I have nothing to do. Tell me a story.
a2b: What?
a9s: Er, there isn't much we can tell you. Most of our data is classified.
eng: A story of the past would be fine.
eng: Tell me about how this city used to be.
a9s: Well, I suppose we can try.
a2b: This city was once home to a great number of humans.
eng: Numbers beyond counting?
a9s: Something like that. Don't you remember driving them out of here?
eng: Humans were already gone at the time of my manufacture.
eng: All I know is ruin. And androids.
a9s: Regardless, don't expect us to forgive you for the sins of your people.
eng: Machine lifeforms do not comprehend the concept of "sin."
a9s: Let's go, 2B.
a2b: Sounds good.
eng: Thank you for visiting me previously.
a2b: How are you?
eng: I am, as one says, "trucking along."
a2b: Does one actually say that?
eng: I have been reading through humanity's records to keep myself occupied.
eng: This has led me to a question.
a2b: Shoot.
eng: What is "night"?
a2b: Night?
a9s: You must mean the cyclical cycle of light and dark that used to exist. The records mentioned that, did they?
a9s: The sun never leaves the sky anymore, but apparently, it used to descend below the horizon for hours at a time.
a9s: When that happened, it was like looking out of one of the Bunker's windows.
a2b: I didn't know that.
eng: I would...like to see...stars sometime...
eng: ......
a9s: What's going on? You seem pretty low, even by machine standards.
eng: My lifespan's expiration period is drawing to a close.
a9s: Are you asking us to repair you? Because that's a pretty selfish request.
eng: No. Do not repair me.
a9s: Huh?
eng: I have been thinking about something.
eng: Do you remember when you spoke of "sin"?
eng: You were right to call it so.
eng: I killed many of your kind. Killed androids beyond counting.
eng: It meant nothing while I was connected to the network.
eng: But now I understand.
eng: I know the anguish it has caused you.
eng: I must atone.
a9s: Wait. Are you...
eng: My existence is ending. I am...dying.
eng: Please take my parts...and use them elsewhere.
