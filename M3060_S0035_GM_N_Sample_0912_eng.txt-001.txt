A dusty wind kisses my cheeks.<bt_wait>

Buried in sand, we pressed forward one
                                                                                 step
                                                                                      at
                                                                                         a
                                                                                           time.<bt_wait>

We have nowhere else to go, after all.
Because our models—the Devola and Popola models—are defective.

When first we woke, there were still people.<bt_wait>
They had flesh. Egos. Emotions. Souls. And they issued us a single order:

<i>Function as observers of Project Gestalt.</i><bt_wait>

This is the sole mission of the twin Devola and Popola models.<bt_wait>
It is the only reason we exist at all.
</page>

<page>
We were the latest model, though many companions shared our appearance.<bt_wait>

There was a sparkle in all of our eyes. A sense of
                                     p r i d e
at having been entrusted with humanity's future.<bt_wait>

And yes, there was anxiety as well.<bt_wait> ...Though not for us.<bt_wait>

We existed as a pair.
We shared destiny's burden as a pair.
And because of that, all hesitation was swept away.

<page>
Each of us were given our own cities as observation areas.
We were ordered to guide the Replicants with our own hands.<bt_wait>

All for the sake of the
"PROMISED TIME"
that would one day arrive.<bt_wait>

We were the only ones who could handle such a duty.
We were observers, after all.

Devola staggers and falls in the soft, unforgiving sand.
I hurry to her side and sigh with relief when I find she's not seriously hurt.<bt_wait>

<i>Are you all right?</i><bt_wait>

<i>Sorry, Sis. Guess I spaced out there for a bit.</i><bt_wait>

She smiles—the same wry smile I know so well—as she rubs absently at her leg.
It is wrapped in a bandage of white.
</page>

<page>
<i>Your bandage is coming undone. Here, let me change it.</i><bt_wait>

<i>It's all right, Popola. Come on—we have to go before we lose the light.</i><bt_wait>

<i>We won't be going anywhere if sand gets into that thing.</i>
