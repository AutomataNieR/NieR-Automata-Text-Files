a2b: Poor thing... You're going to be fine, don't worry.
ys: Ah...
a2b: Pod, send a rescue signal to the Bunker.
pod042: Affirmative.
ys: Eh... Oh...
ys: ...
a2b: No response.
pod042: Limited functionality detected in black box.
a2b: So she's still alive. Contact the Bunker.
pod042: Affirmative.
ys: ...
ys: Eek! Who are you!?
a2b: Don't worry, I'm—
ys: N-no... Get away from me! I don't like the look of you!
pod042: Proposal: remove fear functionality.
ys: No! Stay away! I hate you! I...hate...
a2b: Sorry to startle you. Just stay here and wait for help.
ys: Urrrgh....
ys: So...scared...
pod042: Target location data obtained. Marking on map.
op60: Bunker to 2B.
a2b: 2B here.
op60: We've got a number of broken-down access points on the field.
op60: The cause appears to be an EMP attack from a gigantic machine lifeform.
op60: If you encounter any offline access points, please repair them for us.
a2b: Understood.
pod042: Access point repairs complete.

a2b: Is that...a machine?
a9s: It's freakin' HUGE...
a9s: Crap! It's blocking close-range attacks with EMP blasts.
a9s: We've got to find another way to damage it.
op60: 2B, Command is attempting to launch a satellite laser strike on your target!
op60: But the enemy's electromagnetic camouflage is making it impossible to aim.
op60: We need you to find the emitter and take it out!
a2b: Oh, is that all?
op60: I know, I know! But it's the only way!
pod042: EMP generator target confirmed. Marking on map.
pod042: Proposal: Destroy the generator quickly.
pod042: Enemy data obtained from Command.
a2b: Go ahead.
pod042: The only known record of this machine lifeform is a lone sighting 320 years ago.
pod042: Upon reaching land, the unit unleashed a devastating electromagnetic wave attack.
pod042: All Resistance fighters in the vicinity were annihilated.
a2b: So basically, if this thing reaches land, we're screwed.
pod042: Affirmative.
op60: Electromagnetic interference eliminated!
op60: Preparing for satellite laser strike!

largerobot: This forest we are stationed in...
largerobot: It is hot. Humid. Unhygienic. A punishing hell for machine lifeforms.
largerobot: None should have to live in such a place.
largerobot: ......
largerobot: I have decided.
largerobot: I shall make this our kingdom and declare our independence!
smallrobot: Ummm...
smallrobot: What's a kingdom?
largerobot: Well, it's sort of like a large house.
largerobot: And inside this house, all our people live together as family.
smallrobot: Fam...ily...
smallrobot: I suppose a family might be...good?
smallrobot: Yeah! Families are good!

pod042: Analysis: Both long- and close-range attacks are ineffective.
a2b: Oh, now what?
pod042: Large energy supply detected within this factory.
pod042: Proposal: Energy source should be destroyed.
a2b: 9S?
a2b: That Goliath we just encountered—
a9s: I got it! I've been keeping an eye on you. I'm gonna shut off power to the factory now!
a2b: Do it!
a9s: 2B! I just shut down the electrical grid!
pod042: Enemy shield deactivated.
a9s: Factory system at 80 percent control! Hang in there, 2B!

a2b: What is this?
a9s: Looks like he's bombarding the area with forced connections...
a9s: I think all these transmissions are making the machines go haywire.
a9s: We have to find Eve and destroy him!
a2b: On it.
a9s: Now what?
