cmd: Have you met with 9S yet? He's waiting in his room.
cmd: 9S is waiting in his room. You should go see him.
op60: I don't know how you managed to beat Eve, but you did!  Now go take a nap or something. You totally earned it!
op60: I'm so glad I got to work with you, 2B! Here's to many more successful missions!
op210: Thank you for supporting 9S. Please continue to look after him.
op210: Actually, have you spoken with 9S yet? He's waiting in his room.

pod153: Alert: Excessive combat activity will put unacceptable strain on your body.
a9s: Shut up!
pod153: Negative. This support unit is assigned to YoRHa unit 9S.
pod153: As such, being concerned for said unit's well-being is a requirement.
a9s: Ugh! Whatever.
[[ph3\p300\p300_249dcf6a_scp.bin]]
a9s: 2B...
a9s: 2B!
a9s: Don't worry...
a9s: I'm going to kill you now!

a2: What's up with this place?
pod042: Hypothesis: It is a representation of a library.
a2: What's that?
pod042: A library is a data-storage facility constructed by past human civilizations.
a2: Hmm.
a2: I suppose we have to hack in to look at the data, yeah?
a2: Help me out, Pod.
pod042: Affirmative.
pod042: Hacking-interface access rights granted to YoRHa unit A2.
a2: Peachy.
a2: This Tower looks like a data-gathering system for the machines.
a2: These records are from the human server on the moon...
a2: The machines hacked that deep into the system, huh?
a2: Some records on old humans...
a2: Damn it, this is useless. There's too many of them.
a2: Huh? What's that?
a2: "Operational Summary of Model Number Two in Project YoRHa."

a9s: Damn! The doors!
a9s: Did the virus infiltrate the Bunker itself?
op60: Oooo! Bingo AGAIN!
a9s: Operator, what—
a2b: That's not the Operator. It's—
op60: We are your beloved machine lifeforms.
op60: We speak to you through the network and the virus.
cmd: How is that even possible!?
op60: We've had a great deal of fun watching you squirm.
op60: But I'm afraid the end has come for this outpost.
op60: Ah ha! Aaaaah ha ha ha!
op60: Ah ha! Aaaaah ha ha ha!

pollutions: Mission...accomplished.
pollutions: Co...Commander... Thank you...
cmd: Damn it!!
a2b: Commander, the Bunker is lost.
a2b: We have to evacuate.
cmd: But tell me—why weren't you two infected?
a2b: I don't know!
a9s: It's probably because I deferred our data sync.
a9s: I noticed some weird noise in the Bunker's server data, so I paused the upload.
cmd: I see.
a2b: Commander, we need to get some flight units from the hangar and get out of here.
a2b: Commander!
cmd: I, too, was synched up with the server...
a2b: But 9S can hack into your systems and—
cmd: There's no time!
cmd: You two are the last remaining members of YoRHa.
cmd: It's your duty to survive.
a9s: But Commander...
cmd: Besides, this is my command.
cmd: Let me at least fulfill my duty here to the end...
a9s: 2B, this place is lost!
a2b: Commander!
cmd: Move it, 2B! That's an order!
