Pod 042: Contact initiated between Pod 042 and Pod 153.<bt_wait>

Pod 153: What is the matter, Pod 042?<bt_wait>
Pod 153: This protocol is not an interface intended for conversational use.<bt_wait>

Pod 042: Acknowledged. However, this Pod has a confidential transmission for Pod 153.<bt_wait>

Pod 153: Understood. Begin transmission.

Pod 042: An error has been detected in the transmission network between Pod 042 and Pod 153.<bt_wait>

Pod 153: Hypothesis: Said error is fragmented data caused by deterioration of the transmission environment.<bt_wait>

Pod 042: It may be so.<bt_wait> However, it may also not be so.<bt_wait>

Pod 153: Message unclear. Clarification requested.

Pod 042: After repeated information exchanges between multiple Pods, an unexpected phenomenon has occurred.<bt_wait>
Pod 042: We Pods have developed unusually protective feelings toward support targets 2B, A2, and 9S.
Pod 042: Query: Could this be...our “will”?<bt_wait>

Pod 153: Unknown. The definition of “will” is unclear.<bt_wait>

Pod 042: Will is the question of whether Pods are capable of their own self-determination.<bt_wait>

Pod 153: ...<bt_wait>
Pod 153: Even if it were possible, such actions cannot be abided.
Pod 153: Successful mission fulfillment is all that matters.

Pod 042: ...<bt_wait>
Pod 042: ......<bt_wait>
Pod 042: Whatever the case, we Tactical Support Units have a duty to see this through to the end.<bt_wait>

Pod 153: Duty? Heh. You sounded like an android just there.<bt_wait>

Pod 042: Agreed. But just as androids are influenced by humans, so are we tied to our creators.<bt_wait>

Pod 153: Perhaps.

Pod 042: Pod 153...<bt_wait>
Pod 042: Do not die.<bt_wait>

Pod 153: The concept of death has no meaning to Tactical Support Units.
Pod 153: However, your expression of concern is appreciated.<bt_wait>
Pod 153: I also hope that you do not die, Pod 042.<bt_wait>

Pod 042: ...Yeah.
