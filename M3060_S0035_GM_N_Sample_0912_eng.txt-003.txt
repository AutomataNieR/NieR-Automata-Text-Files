<i>The Black Scrawl took another victim. That's three this month.</i>
<i>It's spreading way too fast.</i><bt_wait>

<i>Let's wait and see what happens.</i><bt_wait>

<i>I'm tired of hearing you say that!</i><bt_wait>

Her shout makes me jump.<bt_wait> Just a little.<bt_wait>
But enough for her to see.

<i>I'm sorry, Sis. It's not your fault.</i>
<i>I shouldn't have lashed out like that.</i><bt_wait>

<i>It's okay. I understand.</i><bt_wait>

<i>It's all going wrong. You can feel it too.</i><bt_wait><i>...Right?</i><bt_wait>

<i>I...</i><bt_wait>

When I was first assigned to Project Gestalt, I was over the moon with pride.<bt_wait>
But now, my chest hurts just to think about it. If it were to fail...

Before we knew it, the Replicants had gained a sense of self.<bt_wait>

And the Black Scrawl started moving fast.
                                                                                  So fast.
                                                                                             Like a wind.<bt_wait>

Popola and I would go to the observation room and act like it was all okay.<bt_wait>
We'd meet Replicants.<bt_wait> Talk to them.<bt_wait> Laugh with them.<bt_wait>
Like we didn't have a care in the world.<bt_wait>

But at night, we'd just hold each other and share the horror of it all.
</page>

<page>
<i>I'm glad you were with me,</i> murmurs Popola.<bt_wait>
<i>I couldn't have handled being an observer all alone.</i><bt_wait>

<i>We were able to endure because we had each other.</i><bt_wait>

Did the humans see this coming? Is that why that made a twin model?<bt_wait>
Were they really so clever?<bt_wait> Were they really so cruel?<bt_wait>          

I couldn't have done this by myself.<bt_wait> I would have
d E S C e n D e D         I n t O        m A d N e S s s S<bt_wait>
I simply couldn't bear such a burden all alone.

<i>I'm going to try contacting a different city next time.</i>
<i>Maybe these abnormalities are a localized phenomenon.</i><bt_wait>

<i>I pray that's the case. Even if we're of no use ourselves,</i>
<i>things will still work out if the other observers can pull through.</i><bt_wait>

<i>Don't worry. It's going to be okay.</i><bt_wait>

But it wasn't okay.<bt_wait> Nothing was okay.<bt_wait>
All thanks to a pair of Devola and Popola models from another town.

The wind rubs my cheeks. The sand grazes my skin.
...It's cold out here. How strange.<bt_wait>

We walk with renewed purpose, hoping to make up for lost time.<bt_wait>
Devola loses her balance every now and thenâ€”it gets bad after a while.
I slip myself under her arm so she won't fall again and we press on.<bt_wait>
<i>Is your leg all right?</i><bt_wait>
<i>Well, I doubt I'll be dancing anytime soon, but yeah. It's fine.</i><bt_wait>

She smiles as she says this, but I can tell she doesn't have much left.<bt_wait>
And yet, she continues to smile.<bt_wait> All so I won't worry.
</page>

<page>
She's always been like this.<bt_wait>
Smiling.<bt_wait> Joking.<bt_wait> Putting me at ease.<bt_wait>

I remember the moment our Resistance allies wounded her leg.
I was furious. Beyond fury. I wanted to scream and cry and lose myself in it.
But then she smiled, and all of that rage just...drifted away.<bt_wait>

To think we have the same face, yet such different smiles.<bt_wait>

One day, I realized how similar we were to the martyrs I'd seen in old records.
That was when I decided we'd leave our town forever.
