pascal: No one could figure out how to stop it.
pascal: We eventually marooned it deep in the ocean, but it seems to be searching for a way back.
a2b: Huh.
a9s: Hey, 2B?
a9s: I think I have another idea!
a9s: You keep that thing right where it is, okay!?
a2b: What!?
a9s: Please, 2B! This is gonna work!
[[ph2\p200\p200_cc694d55_scp.bin]]
ane: 2B!
a2b: You okay?
ane: They came out of nowhere. Overran the entire camp.
ane: We tried to fight back, but our shots have no effect!
pod042: Alert: Energy shields detected on multiple enemy fighters.
pod042: Physical attacks recommended.
a2b: Got it. You get the other androids out of here!
ane: Good luck!
ane: 2B, you...you saved our lives.
a2b: What's going on here?
ane: I have no idea. They came out of nowhere and just—
a2b: Huh!?
ane: That was outside the camp!
[[ph2\p200\p200_d0a7f4dc_scp.bin]]
pascal: Well, THAT was certainly something.
pascal: I had no idea such a vast space existed beneath the abandoned factory!
pascal: I need to return and investigate as soon as possible.
pascal: When I do, perhaps you'd be willing to join me?
a2b: No thanks.
a2b: I'm heading back to the Resistance camp.
a2b: What about you?
pascal: Oh, I'll probably wander back to the village. I have plenty on my plate there.
a2b: I see.
ane: This...Resistan...camp!
a2b: Say again? I'm not receiving.
pod042: Scanning for interference.
ane: ...Machines......!
ane: Requesting...backup...forces! Please......
a2b: Let's move.
a2b: Why are their numbers increasing like this?
pod042: Cause unknown.
a2b: Try contacting the Bunker via laser relay system.
pod042: Affirmative.
resiman: No... Nooooo!
resiwoman2: Somebody help me!
resiman: Get out of here now!

telo: 128 Years Ago...
smallrobot: His Majesty. He's...dead.
smallrobot: The king who gave all for us...
smallrobot: So benevolent and kind... And now he's dead.
smallrobot: This sure is sad.
smallrobot: It sure is.
smallrobot: But we Royal Knights still have a mission.
smallrobot: We placed His Majesty's memory—his final memento—into this tiny child.
smallrobot: And now we must raise this child so he might one day be our new king.
smallrobot: He deserves a royal upbringing...
smallrobot: He deserves protection...

pod042: Proposal: Prioritize search for 9S.
a2b: I know. Let's move.
a2b: What is this?
pod042: Analysis: This area is composed of crystallized silicon and carbon.
pod042: Further details unknown.
a2b: Who built it?
pod042: Unknown.
a2b: What's with the corpses?
pod042: It is unlikely the YoRHa units came this far on their own.
pod042: Hypothesis: The enemy must have placed them here deliberately.
[[ph2\p200\p200_d75fa9d2_scp.bin]]
a2b: You again?
pod042: Alert: Local machine lifeforms are converging on the area.
a2b: This is never going to end...
pod042: Hypothesis: The Goliath-class enemy's scream has summoned the local machine lifeforms.
pod042: Proposal: Destroy the Goliath.

a9s: 2B! You okay!?
a2b: I'm fine...
a2b: Let's take this bastard down.
a9s: Right!
a9s: What do we do? There's too many!
pascal: 2B?
pascal: 2B, can you hear me?
pascal: Our village is under—
pascal: Aaaaaaaah!
a9s: Pascal! Come in, Pascal!
a2b: Shit...
[[ph2\p200\p200_e723b449_scp.bin]]
a9s: Oh, COME ON! Its got an electromagnetic barrier over its whole body!?
a4b: Heh. Having trouble over there?
a9s: ...Are you YoRHa?
a4b: Hunter squadron, deploying out of North 12C Defense HQ.
a4b: I'm the commanding officer, 4B.
a4b: Don't worry—we'll take it from here.
a9s: 2B!
a9s: Let's leave this area to the reinforcements.
a9s: I have an idea.
a9s: You and I should meet up at the spot I just marked.
[[ph2\p200\p200_e8cf2a5c_scp.bin]]
a9s: I didn't think...this would be...so hard to control!
