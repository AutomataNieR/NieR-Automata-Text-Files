pascal: My apologies. That's all the information I have.
a9s: I see... All right, thanks.
a2b: Let's stay sharp and head back to the Resistance camp.

smallrobot: No. Not in the slightest.
smallrobot: How can we make him bigger?
smallrobot: I don't know...
smallrobot: We're too dumb to figure that out.
smallrobot: Sure is a cutie, though!
smallrobot: Yeah! So tiny and cute!
smallrobot: We'd better keep him safe.
smallrobot: Right. Can't let anyone into the forest kingdom...
smallrobot: D-Danger! Danger!
smallrobot: Everyone get out now!
smallrobot: Intruders in the kingdom!
smallrobot: Don't let them in here!

n02: The moment we've pined for is here! Let us all go together!
n02: We will become gods and be freed from our torment!
prst: Why did this happen...?
prst: The only option left is to die...
prst: I'm scared... I'm so scared...
prst: We must die...and become gods!

a9s: This must be the commercial structure Pascal was talking about.
a9s: The records say it was once a facility known as a "shopping center."
a2b: No getting through here.
a9s: Maybe there's some kind of mechanism we could engage?
a9s: If we were human, we probably would have gone shopping and such here, right?
a2b: More meaningless conjecture.
a9s: Ha ha! You're so serious, 2B. You know that?
pod042: Alert: Multiple machine lifeforms detected above our position.
n02: All hail the Forest King!
n02: All hail the Forest King!
a9s: Who the heck is the Forest King?
a2b: You're getting distracted.
a9s: Well, what do you expect? I'm a Scanner.
a9s: Combat was never meant to be my forte.
n02: All hail the Forest King!
a9s: Check this guy...
a9s: He's just running away.

n02: Stop! We have no desire to fight you!
a2b: The connection's too unstable to use the transporter.
n02: Ahh... Why did this happen?
n02: I thought we were going to forge peace...
n02: Your Grace...
n02: How could God allow this?
n02: Why did something so cruel have to happen?
n02: We had almost completed the road to peace...
n02: O God, please restore them to their senses...
n02: What happened to everyone?
n02: Somebody help me...
n02: I’m scared...
n02: Ooooh...
n02: It's over... It's all over...
prst: Ahhh... Why did this happen...?
prst: Dying won't make us gods...
prst: Why did His Grace have to die...?
prst: How am I supposed to live now...?
n02: His Grace... His Grace...
n02: God, I'm scared... What's going to happen to us if we die?
n02: Help me, O God... Please, my God...
n02: No... I don't want to die...
n02: No! Please don't kill me!
n02: Nngh... He... He killed all of them...
n02: Ahh, how did it come to this!? Please stop all the killing!
n02: I'll provide you with anything you need!
n02: Do you need anything?
n02: Please... Please save me.

a9s: Man, this job can be pretty rough sometimes, huh?
a2b: We don't get to choose our assignments.
a2b: And you should work on keeping your opinions in check.
a2b: YoRHa aren't allowed to be emotional, remember?
a9s: I think some of us are better at that than others...
a9s: Say, 2B?
a2b: What?
a9s: When do you think you'll be willing to call me "Nines"?
a2b: 9S works just fine.
a9s: Well, yeah, but...
