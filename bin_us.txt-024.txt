op210: Destroyed units will simply be replaced. Attacking is pointless.
op210: Now move onto the next one!
op210: Try to sneak up behind your foes, keep out of sight, and then...
a9s: Fiiiine.
op210: Boom! Hack 'em up good.
op210: Defensive system operation confirmed to be declining.
a9s: Um, okay.
a9s: Almost there.
a9s: ..."Boom?" Is she serious?
op210: Enemy defense system fully offline.\nI knew you could do it.
pod153: Analysis: It is not possible to hack directly into the target Goliath-class machine lifeform.
pod153: Special software protection detected. Enemy is refusing access from anything other than machine lifeforms.
pod153: Proposal: Unit 9S should commandeer a smaller enemy and use it to hack the large one.
a9s: A little multi-level hacking, huh?
op210: Looks like it's going well down there.
a9s: I-I always do...
op210: Every Scanner in the force is involved in this operation.
op210: That really was brilliant work, which means I've got a special surprise for you.
op210: So let's try not to fall behind.
op210: I'll leave it in my room so you can pick it up later.
a9s: Yeah, yeah. No falling behind. Got it.
a9s: ...A surprise?
op210: 9S?
a9s: What is it?
op210: Make sure to do whatever is necessary to avoid combat.
a9s: And how will I provide support to the squad if I don't fight?
op210: Scanner units such as yourself are not designed for battle.
a9s: Aw, are you worried about me?
op210: No. I'm merely pointing out that you would be a liability on the battlefield.
a9s: Wow, that's...harsh.
a11s: 11S to 9S, come in.
a9s: 9S here. Go ahead.
a11s: I'm just about wrapped up here. How about you?
a9s: Um, just one left, I think.
a11s: Roger.
a11s: Be sure to head back to the Bunker when you're done so you can sync your data.
a9s: Oh, right. I forgot about that.
a11s: Until your combat data is uploaded, none of the Scanner modules can run updates.
a9s: Okay. I'll take care of it as soon as I'm done here.
a11s: Appreciated.
a9s: Whew... That looks like everything.
a9s: Here we go...
pod153: Proposal: Unit 9S should rendezvous with unit 2B before the combat situation worsens.
a9s: Sounds like a plan.
a9s: Lemme just mark the point on the map. Aaaand...there.
pod153: Alert: Exiting the planned operational area.
pod153: Proposal: Return to the operational area immediately.

announce: Welcome to the Tower!

a9s: You bastards...!
announce: Because you made it this far, we have a special announcement just for you...
girls: Because you made it this far, we have a special announcement just for you...
girls: We'll reveal it once you destroy all the machine lifeforms here.
girls: You did it.
girls: You did it.
girls: Now let us show you what we promised.
girls: We are conceptual human personalities created within the machine network.
girls: We cannot be destroyed.
girls: YoRHa unit 9S...
girls: Your attack is meaningless.

a9s: Shut up!
a9s: Keep 'em coming...
a9s: I'll destroy them all...
a9s: All of them...AND this Tower!

cmd: Have you met with 9S yet? He's waiting in his room.
cmd: 9S is waiting in his room. You should go see him.
op60: I don't know how you managed to beat Eve, but you did!  Now go take a nap or something. You totally earned it!
op60: I'm so glad I got to work with you, 2B! Here's to many more successful missions!
op210: Thank you for supporting 9S. Please continue to look after him.
op210: Actually, have you spoken with 9S yet? He's waiting in his room.
bs: You seem a bit worn down. Let me take a look.
bs: Need any maintenance?
bs: Afraid I can't even give heroes a discount, but I can probably arrange a special bit of tuning if you'd like.
cmd: This could be the final mission. I'm depending on you.
cmd: Head out from the hangar.\n...And good luck.
op60: We're expecting a fierce battle. Please be careful!
op60: I...I don't want you to die!
op210: 9S has gone ahead and started the mission. Everything is proceeding well at the moment.
op210: Join up with him on-site and lend support however you can.
bs: Need some last-minute maintenance?
bs: Good luck.

pod153: Wounded in battle. NFCS not functioning.
dbl: I'm amazed you were even able to drag yourself here.
dbl: This is gonna take a bit, so just hang tight.
ppl: This is terrible! Your motor cortex is full of holes.
ppl: I can't believe you even managed to walk here.
dbl: All right, you're all good.
system: NFCS fully recovered.
