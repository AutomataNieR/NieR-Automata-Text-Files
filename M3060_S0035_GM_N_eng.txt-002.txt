Taking a deep breath, I...

<sele_SYURI>・check the circuitry to see if it can be repaired.
<sele_HOUTAI>・replace the bandage and hope for the best.

As expected, wiring in the nerve circuitry has been damaged.
Replacing it will require new connectors, as well as some tools.<bt_wait>

None of which is easy to find in a desert.

I want to repair this as soon as possible, but I have no tools or materials.
And I know I won't find either in the middle of a desert.<bt_wait>

For now, the important thing is to make sure the wound doesn't get worse.

“Sorry about this, Sis,” mutters Devola.<bt_wait>
That wry smile again.<bt_wait> It kills me every time.<bt_wait>
“Don't you dare apologize,” I respond. “You've done nothing wrong.”<bt_wait>
I calmly change the bandage, trying not to let my worry show.
I make it as tight as possible so no sand can slip inside.
It's all I can do until I get the proper materials.<bt_wait>

But that's going to be a tall order, considering our current condition.

“I'm sorry, Sister.”<bt_wait>
“Okay, now YOU'RE apologizing!”<bt_wait>

We both apologize while insisting the other's apology isn't necessary.<bt_wait>
It's kind of funny in a way. Such a trivial exchange under such circumstances?

We laugh together, the sound echoing out across the desert before being stolen
by the cool evening wind.

Relapses increasing...

“There has to be some way to prevent relapses!”<bt_wait>
Devola's sharp voice echoes through our private quarters.
“You must be quiet, Sister. The Replicants will hear.”<bt_wait>
“Pffft. They wouldn't understand even if they did.”<bt_wait>
“That might be true, but regardless...”
</page>

<page>
Annoyed at my hesitation, Devola crosses her legs and scowls.

“The Black Scrawl took another victim,” she says. "That's three this month.
It's spreading way too fast.”<bt_wait>
“Let's wait and see what happens.”<bt_wait>
“I'm tired of hearing you say that!”<bt_wait>

Her shout makes me jump. Just a little—but enough for her to notice.
Seeing that, her eyes suddenly open wide.

“I'm sorry, Sis. It's not your fault. I shouldn't have lashed out like that.”<bt_wait>
“It's okay. I understand.”<bt_wait>
“It's all going wrong. You can feel it too, right?”<bt_wait>
“I...”<bt_wait>

When I was first assigned to Project Gestalt, I was over the moon with pride.<bt_wait>
But now, my chest hurts just to think about it. If it were to fail...

Before we knew it, the Replicants had gained a sense of self
and the Black Scrawl started raging out of control.<bt_wait>
