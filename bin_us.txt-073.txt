eml: You may be a cherished companion of mine, but you still must be punished!
eml: Hee hee hee heeeee! Justice prevails!

[[quest\qab6\qab6_69325679_scp.bin]]
pod153: Proposal: Engage memory core diagnostics.
a9s: Yeah, yeah.
pod153: A single reply is sufficient for acknowledgment.
a9s: Fiiine.
pod153: Memory core diagnostics complete. No issues detected.
a9s: Good.
pod153: Proposal: Engage visual sensor diagnostics.
a9s: You got it.
pod153: Visual sensor diagnostics complete. No issues detected.
pod153: All checks complete.
a9s: Whew... Took long enough.
a9s: Don't you think it's overkill to perform a full data overhaul?
pod153: Unit 9S was seized by the enemy and placed in a non-controlled state for an extended period of time.
pod153: There is a high probability of corruption by an enemy logic virus.
a9s: All right, all right. Cram it.
a9s: Anyway, I just gotta synch up with the Bunker server and then I'm outta here, right?
a9s: Huh? What was that?
pod153: Unknown.
a9s: Halt the data sync.
pod153: Alert: Data synchronization is mandatory for all YoRHa units.
a9s: Yeah, I know that. But we just got some kind of weird noise.
a9s: Halt the data sync for 2B as well.
pod153: Affirmative.
a9s: Let's figure out where that noise came from. Just to be sure, you know?
a9s: Open a port to the server.
a9s: Hmm... No time to examine everything. Better stick to the main data nodes.
pod153: Detected: Access log to Council of Humanity's lunar server.
a9s: What's a barrier doing here...?
a9s: Hmm... Looks like records for supplies shipped to the moon.
a9s: Strange... There were a ton of empty containers.
a9s: That's weird. Why would they do that?
pod153: Detected: YoRHa unit storage records.
a9s: What's the point of all this heavy security?
a9s: All the black box data has been deleted, but it looks like everything else is here.
a9s: ...Huh? A new port just opened.
pod153: Detected: Council of Humanity and Project YoRHa records index.
pod153: Alert: We are not authorized to access this data.
a9s: Man, this stuff is all wrong...
a9s: I need to check this out too.
a9s: An attack barrier? Really!?
a9s: Why the heck would they install one of those in this server...?
a9s: Let's see... Looks like info about how the Council of Humanity was formed as part of Project YoRHa.
a9s: Wait. Isn't that backwards?
a9s: After a long period of battles and adventures, the prophet spoke.
a9s: O grant me the mercy of the land!
a9s: O grant me the joy of the heavens!
a9s: Release me from my yoke of iron!
a9s: Thus shall our souls be—
a9s: ......
a9s: What was that?
a9s: Crap! Did they find me?
pod153: Negative. Emergency backup request from 2B.
a9s: Close the server connection and activate my body.
a9s: Affirmative.

a2b: 9S?
a2b: That Goliath we just encountered—
a9s: I got it! I've been keeping an eye on you. I'm gonna shut off power to the factory now!
a2b: Do it!
a9s: 2B! I just shut down the electrical grid!
a9s: Factory system at 20 percent control. You have to hold out for me, 2B!
a9s: Factory system at 50 percent control! Now we just have to do something about this core...
a9s: Factory system at 80 percent control! Hang in there, 2B!
a9s: 90 percent... 92... 95... 98...
a9s: I'd better secure her an escape route...
a9s: There we go. First door unlocked!
a9s: Door two disabled.
