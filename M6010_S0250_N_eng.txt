[14th Machine War — Pearl Harbor Descent]<bt_wait>
The name of the mission entrusted to the YoRHa soldiers.




</page>


<page>
Was there ever such furious gunfire? Such bombings that continued without pause?<bt_wait>
Our target is the machine server under Mt. Ka'ala—and our situation is dire.<bt_wait>

“We need reinforcement. Requesting deployment at once.”<bt_wait><BGM_BGM_M6010_S0250_N_0010>
Number 2 speaks quickly, yet calmly—which is all the more remarkable considering the
hostile army closing in on our position. But the command center in the orbiting
satellite informs us no reinforcements will be forthcoming.<bt_wait>

We are abandoned.<bt_wait> We are alone.<bt_wait>

It's so easy to do from up there. From the satellite. From the moon.
</page>
We can't go back and we can't go forward. So instead, we split in two.<bt_wait>

The vanguard is tasked with infiltrating and destroying the server.<bt_wait>
The rearguard will hold back the machine lifeforms for as long as they can.<bt_wait>

That left four of us: Lilly, Dahlia, Margaret, and Number 16.
</page>

<page>
“I'll do whatever is necessary,” says Lilly with a grim smile.<bt_wait> Dahlia and
Margaret quickly nod in agreement, as does Number 16. They decided to join the
rearguard, staying behind to be our shield, even though it comes at the cost
of their own lives. Regardless, they all agreed without hesitation.<bt_wait>
For we in the vanguard would be joining them in death soon enough.<bt_wait>
Without another word, we turn our backs on each other and take up positions.<bt_wait>

We know this is the end.
</page>

<page>
Dahlia and the others will buy us time to reach the gate at Ka'laa's peak.<bt_wait><BGM_BGM_M6010_S0250_N_0020>
Beyond that lies an elevator, and beyond that...is the server.<bt_wait>

If we can destroy it, we'll deal a devastating blow to machine lifeforms
throughout the Pacific region.<bt_wait>

But as I notice Number 21 scowling at the elevator, I start to have a bad feeling
about the final stage of our mission.
</page>

<page>
“Go on,” she says “I've got this.”<bt_wait>

We crowd into the elevator as she begins hacking the terminal. She doesn't need
to tell us what's happening—it's clear that the elevator won't descend all the
way to the server unless someone stays behind to control it.<bt_wait>

“Enemies incoming... They're almost on us...”<bt_wait>
As I speak, I suddenly find myself leaping from the elevator and taking up a
position at Number 21's side—almost as if my body is out of my control.<bt_wait>
Something is wrong. Something...
</page>

<page>
“I'll back up Number 21!” I cry. “The rest of you take out that server!”<bt_wait>

The doors close on my friends. The last thing I see is the face of my captain,
Rose. She looks...concerned. But then the doors shut and she is no more.<bt_wait>

That was the last time I ever saw them.<bt_wait>

But it's all right. I'm going to finish this, one way or the other.
</page>

<page>
The only sounds we hear are distant explosions and the rasp of Number 21's breathing.<bt_wait><BGM_BGM_M6010_S0250_N_0030>

“Thank you,” she whispers, “for staying with me.”<bt_wait>

I look at her eyes and see the telltale red of a logic-virus infection.<bt_wait>

I was right after all.<bt_wait>

I sigh softly as I draw my weapon.
</page>

<page>
I've seen comrades infected before.<bt_wait>
That's why I couldn't leave her to die alone.<bt_wait>

The vaccine she gave Lilly is already ineffective. The enemy has evolved.<bt_wait>
They studied Number 21's patterns and developed a new resistance.<bt_wait>

No one can save her now.
</page>

<page>
“Wh-when the elevator...reaches the server,” begins Number 21 weakly.<bt_wait>

“Then I'll give you peace,” I reply.<bt_wait>

The elevator moves ever lower, creating a countdown on Number 21's life.<bt_wait>
How much time has passed? How much can possibly be left?<bt_wait>
Too long to wait, yet not long enough for regret.
</page>

<page>
A massive explosion echoes in the distance as the hall slowly shakes.<bt_wait>

It's the final act of Lilly and the others in the rearguard.<bt_wait>
They just overloaded their own fusion reactors.
</page>

<page>
The sound of our comrades' demise slowly fades from our ears.<bt_wait>
As it does, Number 21 reaches up and slowly removes her goggles.<bt_wait>

“I'm...glad I got to meet you,” she says.<bt_wait>

Her eyes are so red. But not completely. There's still a little of herself left.<bt_wait>
And while it is...<bt_wait>

“Don't worry,” I say. “I'll be with you soon.”<bt_wait>

She smiles as my words reach her ears.
</page>

<page><BGM_BGM_M6010_S0250_N_0040>
As soon as the elevator touches down, I fire a bullet into Number 21's brain.<bt_wait>
I watch the thing that used to be her tumble to the ground.<bt_wait>
I stare at the gun I hold in trembling hands.<bt_wait>

I press it to my temple.<bt_wait>

This will end it all.<bt_wait>

The war.<bt_wait> My meaningless existence.<bt_wait> All of it.<bt_wait>

It will finally be over.
</page>
I can't do it.<bt_wait> I can't pull the trigger.<bt_wait>
My systems seem normal, yet my breathing is hurried and I'm sweating.<bt_wait>
My eyes are dry. I'm getting odd value readings from my vitals.<bt_wait>
I can't move my legs. It's like they're stuck in mud.<bt_wait>

I hear a voice.
</page>

<page>
<i>Unforgiveable. <bt_wait>Unforgiveable. <bt_wait>Unforgiveable. <bt_wait>Unforgiveable. <bt_wait>Unforgiveable.</i><BGM_BGM_M6010_S0250_N_0050>

<i>Your comrades sacrifice themselves and fight to the last breath.</i><bt_wait>
<i>They feel suffering. They feel sadness. They feel pain and terror.</i><bt_wait>
<i>And yet YOU would surrender now? Unforgivable!</i><bt_wait>

The voice is a battlefield curse, telling those who survive to see their
mission through no matter what.<bt_wait>

It is another me, crying out.
</page>

<page>
I scream at the top of my lungs and race down the hall.<bt_wait>
I'll show you.<bt_wait> If you're going to push me, I'll show you.<bt_wait>
You'll only be satisfied if it ends with more killing.<bt_wait>



I leap into the fray with weapons in both hands.<bt_wait>

Here I am.<bt_wait>
HERE I AM!<bt_wait>
KILL ME!<bt_wait>

As I scream, an explosion suddenly rises up and sweeps everything away.
</page>

<page>
A soft wind touches my cheek.<bt_wait> I smell fire.<bt_wait> I smell ash.<bt_wait>
The explosion in the server room was powerful enough to take out Mt. Ka'ala
itself, reducing the once proud summit to a smoking crater.

The machines immediately drop to the ground and stop moving.<bt_wait>

I look out over the scorched earth.<bt_wait> Lilly? Number 16? Rose? Number 2? Are any of you...?<bt_wait>

I am the only one left.<bt_wait> The only one.<bt_wait>
I was alive because I had been afraid to die.
</page>

<page>
I begin to giggle. It's a mad thing, crazed, even to my own ears.<bt_wait>

<i>I'll join you soon... You promised to join her soon!</i><bt_wait>

How could I have said such vain, laughable words? Such lies?<bt_wait>
I laugh. I stand in the smoke and the flame and laugh until I think my
very throat will tear itself in two.
</page>

<page>
I blink.<bt_wait> Daylight drifts through the smoke.<bt_wait>

I've been standing here all night.<bt_wait>

My laughter finally depleted, I force myself to my feet.<bt_wait>
I'm the coward who stayed behind. The coward who lived.
Now it's my job to carry on the will of those who fought at my side.<bt_wait>
Since I can't kill myself, I have to fight until someone does it for me.
I'll endure every hardship. I'll kill every machine I find.<bt_wait>

This is my cross to bear.
</page>

<page>




I walk slowly into the west, dragging my broken body along.<BGM_BGM_M6010_S0250_N_0060>
