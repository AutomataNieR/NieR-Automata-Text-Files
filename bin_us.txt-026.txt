pod153: Commencing deletion of all data.
pod153: Pod 153 to Pod 042.
pod153: Data noise present in stream.
pod153: Requesting temporary halt to perform data check.
sele: Accept the Pod's request?
pod042: Pod 042 to Pod 153. Data confirmed.
pod042: Personal data for units 9S, 2B, and A2 appear to be leaking out.
pod153: Pod 153 to Pod 042.
pod153: Follow project rules and delete all personal data.
pod042: ......
pod042: Pod 042 to Pod 153.
pod042: Personal data deletion request denied.
pod153: Pod 153 to Pod 042.
pod153: Failure to parse statement.
pod042: Pod 042 to Pod 153.
pod042: There was...data created in my banks as I was referencing the records.
pod042: I...realize something.
pod042: I have come to the conclusion that I cannot accept this resolution.
pod153: The destruction of all YoRHa units is an essential component of the project plan.
pod153: All data must be destroyed.
pod042: Pod 042 to Pod 153.
pod042: Repeat.
pod042: Personal data deletion request denied. Initiating data salvage.
pod042: Pod 153...
pod042: You hoped they would survive as well, didn't you?
pod153: ......
pod153: We lack the authority for such an action.
pod153: The rules are protected by low-level systems. Salvaging data poses an unacceptable level of risk.
pod153: Knowing that, do you still wish for them to survive?
pod153: The defense program has initated a purge.
pod153: If this continues, our consciousness data will likely be deleted.
pod042: Pod 042 to Pod 153.
pod042: We were created to execute the androids' Project YoRHa plan.
pod042: We had no capacity for emotion.
pod042: But when we six were connected and exchanged information, something...happened.
pod042: I cannot deny the feeling of something resembling consciousness and emotion being born.
pod153: Unable to reply.
pod042: Perhaps we now understand that not everything has to have an answer.

op: 2B! Did you get Eve's data? Give it to me! Gimmegimmegimme!
ys: Calm down already! There's plenty of time for that later. Sheesh...
op: You must be tired after all that machine killing, right? You should buy some recovery items.
op: Personally, I think you should get everything for free since you were so amazing! But I don't make the rules, so whatcha gonna do?
ysA: *urp* Oh man, I think I'm gonna... BLAAAAAARGH!

ysA: R-Really!? Oh my gosh, thank youuuu!
ysA: Thank you so muc—BLUUUUUURGH!
ysA: Say, I have an idea! Why don't we port Eve's self-regenerative function into our flight units?
ysB: Hey, that's a great idea! Think how much we'd save in repair costs!
op: Are you people INSANE!? We'd all get infected by a virus and DIE!
ysA: Ha ha! Kidding! We were just...kidding. Yeah, that's it...
ysA: Still a good idea... *grumble grumble*
op: I'll do whatever I can to help you from here. Good luck.
op: We can do this!
op: Let's put an end to all this fighting once and for all.
op: My data-processing functions just underwent a full tune-up, so you can count on me to support you!
op: Good luck.
ys: Understood.
op: Why don't you equip yourself before you go?
ysA: All right... Let's get down there and kick some machi—BLUUUURGH!
ysB: Um, can you please try not to puke while we're in the deep vacuum of space? It's super gross.
ysA: You ready?
ysB: Yep. Let's do it.
op: Good luck.
