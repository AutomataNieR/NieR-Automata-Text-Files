a2: Whatever.
a2: What the hell is that huge thing?
pod042: Unknown.
a2: You're pretty useless, you know that?
pod042: Proposal: Unit A2 should state her intentions.
a2: Why the hell would I do that?
pod042: In order to provide optimal support, Pods must be supplied with data relating to the activities of supported units.
a2: Not happening.
pod042: Proposal: Unit A2 should state her intentions.
a2: What did I just say?
pod042: If an attending support unit is not provided with data related to the activity of its target,
pod042: it is programmed to automatically repeat the request every 30 seconds until such data is made available.
a2: Are you kidding me?
pod042: Proposal: Unit A2 should state her intentions.
pod042: Needlessly repeating conversations on the same topic is a waste of energy resources.
a2: You're the one who keeps talking!
pod042: Thirty seconds have passed.
pod042: Proposal: Unit A2 should state her intentions.
a2: Damn it, stop!
a2: My intention is to beat the hell out of every god damn machine I can find! Is that enough for you!?
pod042: Affirmative.
pod042: Scanning and marking of nearby machine lifeforms complete.
pod042: Goliath-class enemies detected in desert area.
pod042: Proposal: Goliath-class enemies should be destroyed.
a2: Don't tell me what to do.
pod042: Pods are not authorized to issue commands.
pod042: Proposals are merely recommendations based on data provided by unit A2.
pod042: Proposal: Unit A2 should state updated intentions in order to secure more usable data.
a2: Shut...the hell...up.
pod042: Negative. This Pod is engaging in activity based on the final order of unit 2B.
pod042: YoRHa unit A2 lacks the authority to issue commands.
a2: Look, just stay out of my way.
pod042: Affirmative.

pod153: Pod 153: Fatal system error detected.
pod153: Pod 153: Memory leak verified. Repair impossible.
pod153: Pod 153: Beginning emergency evacuation of remaining memories.

a2: Damn it...
pod042: Alert: Enemy hacking detected.
pod042: Proposal: Retreat immediately.
a2: Who ARE you!?
girls: Good to see you again...Number Two.
girls: Or should we call you A2 now?
girls: This does bring back memories.
girls: Though to concepts like us, time has little meaning.
girls: Still, when we wiped out your forces, it made quite the impression on us.
girls: YoRHa attacker model Number Two...
girls: An experimental, disposable group created as a test run for Project YoRHa.
a2: Shut up!
girls: You're an obstinate little android, aren't you?
girls: Didn't we say that you can't kill us?
a2: God damn it!
pod042: Proposal:
a2: What now!?
pod042: Utilize the enemy's logical learning function to formulate a weakness.
a2: I don't know what that means!
pod042: This Pod has serious concerns about unit A2's cognitive abilities.
a2: SHUT UP AND EXPLAIN IT ALREADY!
pod042: Said strategy would interrupt the enemy's logic circuits, causing a computational delay.
a2: Meaning what!?
pod042: Do not destroy the enemy.
a2: Huh!?
pod042: Striking at the logic circuit requires a certain number of enemies to remain extant for a certain period of time.
a2: Oh, what the hell...
pod042: The enemy's processing speed has returned to normal.
pod042: Proposal: Do not destroy enemies.
a2: I know, all right!?
pod042: Consciousness data saturation rate 30 percent.
girls: It's all so very amusing...
pod042: Consciousness data saturation rate 60 percent.
girls: The androids the human race left behind acted as if they wanted to be human.
girls: The machine lifeforms the aliens left behind acted as if they wanted to be human.
girls: We resemble each other so, but we are networked, and thus we are superior to you.
pod042: Hypothesis: The enemy's defensive system is prompting an evolution of its logic.
girls: Foolish androids... Why do you resist?
girls: All things end with accepting death, do they not?
pod042: Consciousness data saturation rate 90 percent.
girls: We are one, and yet we are many.
girls: We are finite, and yet we are infinite.
girls: We are the embodiment of the perfect being.
pod042: Hypothesis: The enemy has become aware of the diversity of life.
girls: Ahh... I see it... The light...
girls: We move on... Forward... To the future!
pod042: Consciousness data saturation rate 100 percent.
pod042: Hypothesis: The enemy's consciousness has begun to fracture.
a2: What theâ€”!?
pod042: Analysis: The saturated consciousnesses are now in conflict with each other.
a2: Huh...
a2: They're acting like humans...

a9s: Pod, where's the next resource-recovery unit?
pod153: Alert: NFCS failure.
pod153: Speculation: Failure caused by intense combat and lack of maintenance.
a9s: Near-field controls are down? Great...
pod153: Proposal: Overhaul system at Resistance camp.
a9s: I don't have that kind of time.
pod153: Alert: Entering battle without a functioning sword constitutes an unacceptable risk.
pod153: Unit 9S should have Devola initiate repairs at the Resistance camp.
a9s: Shit...
