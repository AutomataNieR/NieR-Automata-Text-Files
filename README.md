# NieR-Automata-Text-Files
Almost all in-game and menu dialogue. _The files don't follow a chronological order._

This project doesn't contain all story dialogue, for some of them only exists in another format. I'll see if I can upload those later.  You will find main dialogues, side quest dialogues and random NPC dialogues. Every file has several dialogues from different sections of the game, be aware of that. You will follow **bin_us.txt-001** for story dialogue and **EN.txt-001** for menus, items, chapters etc. **M1030_S0310_N_eng** and similar files are in-game novels. Files named as bin_**es** etc are the *spanish* version of NieR:Automata.

The following files have additional dialogues that are not part of the game:

M3060_S0035_GM_N_Sample_0912_eng.txt-001

M3060_S0035_GM_N_Sample_0912_eng.txt-002

M3060_S0035_GM_N_Sample_0912_eng.txt-003

M3060_S0035_GM_N_Sample_0912_eng.txt-004

M3060_S0035_GM_N_Sample_0912_eng.txt-005

They basically contain the Devola and Popola light novel with just a few new lines.
