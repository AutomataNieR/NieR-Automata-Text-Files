pascal: Oh, A2...
a2: So what exactly happened?
pascal: I don't know. Some of the villagers just started to...feed on each other.
pascal: If you hadn't come along, I'm sure we would have met the same grim fate.
pascal: Thank you.
select: Can't you regenerate your dead villagers?
select: Is this factory safe?
select: We really need more info...
pod042: Query: We understand that machine lifeforms can regenerate as long as they possess the required materials. Is this accurate?
pascal: Unfortunately, we cannot regenerate our cores.
pascal: Cores contain the data which forms our self-consciousness.
pascal: If one is destroyed, there is no way to restore it.
pascal: We usually store our cores in safe places,
pascal: but this time, the villagers had their cores destroyed as well as their bodies.
a2: I see...
a2: So is this factory safe?
pascal: It was once occupied by a cadre of fellow machines that had gone berserk.
pascal: However, 2B took care of that threat.
pascal: It is quite safe now.
pascal: We've been using it for storage for some time.
a2: All right.
a2: Still, if we're gonna hole up here, I wish we had more info to work with...
