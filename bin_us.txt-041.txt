a2b: Look.
a9s: That's A2's handiwork, I bet.
a9s: But I'm not picking up any sign of A2 herself.
a9s: Hmm? What in the world...?
a2b: Pod, help me out here.
pod042: Analysis: It is believed to be a data log related to YoRHa unit A2.
a2b: What's the data?
pod042: The data log has been irreparably damaged. Further analysis is impossible.
a2b: Why do a bunch of machines have A2's data?
a9s: Hey, 2B? I'm picking up other reactions. We should check them out.
ane: Is that...A2's data?
a2b: Some of it. But it's badly damaged, so we didn't learn much.
ane: It's still something. Thank you.
ane: You know, there might be more data chips in that same area.
ane: Please let me know if you find any.
a9s: Okay, I think that's the last of the data chips.
a2b: Pod, analyze and collate the information from those chips.
pod042: Analysis complete: Data set contains information about YoRHa unit A2.
pod042: Collating with data from other chips. Stand by...
pod042: Collation complete. The contained data is a debriefing report for the Pearl Harbor descent undertaken during the 14th Machine War.
a2b: No kidding.
a9s: That operation was carried out by the YoRHa generation that came before us, right?
a9s: Anyway, mission complete, I suppose. Let's get back to the Resistance camp.
a9s: We found more data from A2. Take a look.
ane: That's... It's Number 2.
ane: It really is her.
a2b: You know her?
ane: YoRHa unit Number 2. She's an older model, but the same type as you.
ane: We...worked together.
a9s: The Pearl Harbor drop?
ane: Yes.
ane: The operation itself was a success, but the YoRHa fighters were completely wiped out.
ane: Their commander was Number 2... A2.
ane: Have you met her? Do you know where she is?
a9s: Actually, we have orders from the Bunker to...destroy her.
ane: What!?
a9s: She's a deserter. She also wiped out an entire team that was sent to bring her back.
ane: A2...? No...
ane: I'm sorry, I...
a9s: ......
a2b: Let's go, 9S.
a9s: Wonder what that was all about? Something must've been up between Anemone and A2...
a2b: Some things just aren't easy to talk about.
a2b: Especially for a soldier who's been fighting that long.
a9s: I guess so.
a2b: 9S, you...
a9s: Huh?
a2b: ...You might understand yourself someday.
a9s: Right...

resiwoman: Owwwwww...
a9s: Hey, you're with the Resistance, right? Are you okay?
resiwoman: Nnngh... You know that explosion that happened in the ruins?
resiwoman: The shockwave hit me like...well, a shockwave, I guess. Knocked my circuits all out of whack, but I managed to—
resiwoman: Wait a second... You look familiar—have we met before?
a2b: Me? No. But lots of YoRHa models look alike.
resiwoman: Oh... So, you two are with YoRHa, are you?
a9s: Um, yes? Why do you want to know?
resiwoman: No reason! I mean, I've just heard stories about how advanced you guys are, and how kind, and...
resiwoman: Okay, fine. I need help.
a9s: Well, sure, I guess? What's the problem?
resiwoman: What happened is, my friend who was with me on this mission was killed, and...
resiwoman: I want to retrieve her final moments.
resiwoman: This broken Pod was recording her life log. Think you can get it for me?
sele: Help her out.
sele: Refuse.
resiwoman: Thank you.
resiwoman: I need you to get my friend's life log out of this Pod...
a9s: All right. I just need to extract some images, right?
telo: You extracted the images from the life log.
a9s: ...That was the last entry contained in the life log.
a9s: I could be wrong, but it looked like two Resistance members fighting each other.
resiwoman: So my friend was killed by the Resistance? By one of her own!?
a9s: Easy. We haven't finished fully restoring the data.
a9s: It won't be complete until we dig into a deeper layer and—
resiwoman: No. That's enough. I don't need to know any more.
resiwoman: That person in the red hood killed my friend...
resiwoman: And she's going to pay for it!
a9s: Wait!
resiwoman: What is it?
a9s: Where are you going?
resiwoman: To kill the bastard who murdered my friend!
a9s: Just slow down, all right? We need more data about what happened.
a9s: Besides, it's dangerous. The killer could be watching you right now for all we know.
resiwoman: Fine then. What do YOU think I should do?
a9s: Let me ask around the Resistance camp before you go running off.
a9s: There can't be that many people in red hoods, after all. Someone must know something.
resiwoman: All right. I can wait for a little while.
resiwoman: Hey, and...thanks.
a2b: Well. Aren't we generous?
a9s: Hmm?
a2b: All this help for no personal gain? I know she's pretty, but—
a9s: Whoa, whoa! It's not like that!
a9s: I mean, she IS pretty, but that's... It's not...
a2b: Whatever.
a9s: We need to find someone wearing a red hood.
a9s: Say, nice hood. You make it?
resiwoman2: What, this? No, a girlfriend of mine gave it to me.
resiwoman2: This is the first time I've worn it in public. Do you really like it?
a9s: Yeah, it's great. In fact, I wish I had one for myself.
