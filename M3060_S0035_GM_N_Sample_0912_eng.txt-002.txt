<i>Now quit whining and hold still. I'll be quick.</i><bt_wait>

Devola grunts and turns away.<bt_wait> I take it as consent.<bt_wait>
Soon we are resting in the shade of a nearby rock as I
s l o o o w l y
pull the balky bandage free.

<page>
Artificial skin—torn and bloodied—peeks out from beneath the bandage.
Judging by Devola's current lack of ambulatory control,
I imagine the circuitry underneath has been damaged as well.<bt_wait>

Taking a deep breath, I...

<sele_SYURI>check the circuitry to see if it can be repaired.
<sele_HOUTAI>replace the bandage and hope for the best.

As expected, wiring in the nerve circuitry has been damaged.
Replacing it will require new connectors, as well as some tools.<bt_wait>

...None of which is easy to find in a desert.

I need to repair this as soon as possible.
But I have no tools. Or materials.
And I know I won't find either in the middle of a desert.<bt_wait>

For now, the important thing is to make sure the wound doesn't get worse.

<i>Sorry about this, Sis,</i> mutters Devola.<bt_wait>

That wry smile again.<bt_wait> It kills me every time.<bt_wait>
<i>Don't you dare apologize. You've done nothing wrong.</i><bt_wait>
I calmly change the bandage, trying not to let my worry show.
I make it as tight as possible so no sand can slip inside.
It's all I can do until I get the proper materials.<bt_wait>

But that's going to be something of a tall order.
I mean, considering our current condition.

<page>
<i>I'm sorry, Sister.</i><bt_wait>

<i>Okay, now YOU'RE apologizing!</i><bt_wait>

We both apologize while insisting the other's apology isn't necessary.
It's kind of funny, in a way.
Such a trivial exchange under such circumstances?<bt_wait>

We laugh together, the sound echoing out across the desert
before being stolen away by the cool evening wind.

*Fade-out

Relapses increasing...

<page>
<i>There has to be some way to prevent relapses!</i><bt_wait>
Devola's voice echoes through our private quarters.
...Subtlety was never her strong suit.<bt_wait>

<i>You must be quiet, Sister. The Replicants will hear.</i><bt_wait>

<i>Pffft. They wouldn't understand even if they did.</i><bt_wait>

<i>That might be true, but regardless...</i>
</page>

Annoyed at my hesitation, Devola crosses her legs and scowls.<bt_wait>
