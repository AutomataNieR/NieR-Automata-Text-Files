I dive deeper into the records...<bt_wait>
I can find no indication of the machines creating new cultures or values.
They only imitate human behavior.<bt_wait>

The strange thing is, if a unit fails, it fails in exactly the same way the next time.<bt_wait>
For example, if a machine forms a dictatorship that eventually collapses,
it won't try a new type of government—it just forms a new dictatorship.<bt_wait>
Or if it plants crops and they die, it just tries the same thing again.<bt_wait>
And again.<bt_wait> And again.<bt_wait> And again.<bt_wait>

They keep performing the same behaviors. They don't ever LEARN.

When it comes to combat, the machines show overwhelming adaptive behavior and
evolutionary speed.<bt_wait>

So why do they insist on imitating humanity?
And more specifically, why do they imitate their failures?<bt_wait>

It's almost as if the objective is <i>failure itself</i>.<bt_wait>

I sense a change in the data. Some kind of movement.<bt_wait>
I hone my perception and hold my breath.

“I...”<bt_wait><BGM_BGM_M1070_S0060_N_0010>

I hear something. A distant voice.<bt_wait>

“I annou...”<bt_wait>

“...all androids...”<bt_wait>

There's something there. Something clearly intelligent.
