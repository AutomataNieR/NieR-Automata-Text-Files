kj: I am the blacksmith Masamune.
kj: I see you're taking good care of your weapons.
kj: However, I'd be happy to sharpen them for you if you wish.
kj: Ah! Your white sword!
kj: My master honed that very blade long ago.
kj: He was a master craftsman who gathered four black and four white weapons and improved on them.
kj: But they spilled so much blood that my master sealed them away in various locations across the world.
kj: However, I wager you would wield them in the service of good. If that is true, you can search for them in sealed shrines throughout the world.
kj: Have you any weapons you wish for me to sharpen?
kj: Weapons are mirrors that reflect what is in your heart. Treat them with the care they deserve.
kj: Hmm... It has been long and long since I've seen someone take such good care of a weapon. Please take this as a token of my appreciation.
kj: This is one of the weapons I was telling you about. It was passed down through the generations until it came to me, and I can't bring myself to seal it away.
kj: But I know you will give it the respect it craves.

apolorobo: Sorry! My apologies, but I cannot let you pass.
apolorobo: Please do not ask why! I really wish I could have avoided this situation altogether.
apolorobo: It's just that...I, I cannot let you through!
apolorobo: I'm sure that...some day...DON'T ASK WHEN...I will be able to let you pass...maybe.
apolorobo: No wait! Scratch all that! Actually, it's all up to you!
apolorobo: Sorry, and I truly, truly am sorry, but that's all I can say for now.
apolorobo: I know it's not much of an apology, but to make up for my insolence, please allow me to self-destruct!
apolorobo: This will result in a rain of useful materials. They are yours to keep!
