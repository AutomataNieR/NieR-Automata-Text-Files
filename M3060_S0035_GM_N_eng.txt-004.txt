my sister and I were the perfect target for persecution.
</page>

<page>
At first, we simply accepted the fact that our friends turned on us.<bt_wait>
It was almost unavoidable, I suppose.
We were observers for Project Gestalt, after all.<bt_wait>
And while we didn't cause it to fail, the people who did...<bt_wait>
Well, they looked just like us.<bt_wait>

So we accepted it. We took the resentment and scorn. We endured.<bt_wait>
Because as crazy as it sounds, I think we actually felt...<bt_wait>responsible.
</page>

<page>
We moved from town to town in an effort to avoid persecution.
But in one such town, my seemingly infinite patience finally broke.<bt_wait>
My sister, Devola, met with unprovoked violence at the hands of a Resistance member.
She said something in response to his taunts.<bt_wait> Something quiet.<bt_wait>
And though her words were ambiguous, he slashed her leg nearly in two.<bt_wait>

My vision narrowed. Everything went red. And then...she smiled at me.<bt_wait>
“It's okay, Sis. There's nothing we can do.”<bt_wait>
But it was too late. My emotions were no longer in my control.<bt_wait>
I'm simply not strong enough to stand aside and let the most important person
in the world come to harm.
</page>

<page>
Devola and I left town that same day.

Violence like that wouldn't stop. It was going to happen again.<bt_wait>
And it wouldn't be coming from just one person.<bt_wait>

So rather than let them kill us, we ran.
I guess it was the greatest resistance I could muster.

...Desert Part 4
<BGLOAD_1_4>
<BGON_1_4>
<page>
We lose the sun as dark clouds gather overhead.<bt_wait>
We continue our march.<bt_wait>

A cold wind blasts us, stealing what little body heat we have left.<bt_wait>
I smell rain in the air.<bt_wait>
We continue our march.<bt_wait>

Sometimes we hear animals howling in the distance.<bt_wait>
It makes us flinch every time.<bt_wait>
But we continue our march, because even this is better than suffering at the
hands of our fellow androids.
</page>

<page>
Why must we suffer this persecution?<bt_wait>
I know we're the same model as the androids who doomed humanity,
so I understand that part.<bt_wait> At least a little, anyway.<bt_wait>
But at the same time, we're <i>not</i> them. We're <i>not</i> the same.
We are who <i>we</i> are, and that Devola and Popola were who <i>they</i> were.<bt_wait>
That's how I felt when I saw Devola being hurt.
I wanted to shout it at everyone. I wanted to scream.<bt_wait>

As far as I'm concerned, there's only one Devola.<bt_wait> And for her, there's only me.<bt_wait>
No one can take the other's place.
</page>

<page>
Rain falls from the sky.
It stimulates our sensation nerves like cold needles.<bt_wait>

We need maintenance badly. But that's a pipe dream, I suppose.<bt_wait>
No android would dare help a pair of outcasts like us.
</page>

<page>
“Are you cold, Devola?”<bt_wait>
“I'm all right as long as you're with me, Sis.”<bt_wait>
“I feel the same.”<bt_wait>

We press our bodies together to try and retain heat.
It's cold now. Much worse than the searing heat of midday.
But we just smile at each other and keep pressing on.<bt_wait>
There's another camp on the other side of the desert. A new camp.
If we can just get there, I can finally fix Devola's leg.
</page>


<page>
And yet, I wonder if there's anywhere on this planet that will take us.

“Hey. What's wrong?”<bt_wait>
“...It's nothing. Don't worry about it.”<bt_wait>

I do what I can to suppress the anxiety in my chest and keep walking.
</page>

<page>
The rain grows worse. It lashes at us without pause.<bt_wait>
