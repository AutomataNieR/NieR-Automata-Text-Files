cmd: We've picked up a signal from the black box of a fugitive known as A2.
cmd: What you see in front of you...is your enemy.
a9s: But she's—
cmd: She deserted us. She's destroyed multiple pursuit androids.
cmd: Now kill her before she kills you!
a9s: Operator, this is 9S. Patch me through to the Commander.
a9s: Let's go after her, 2B!
a2b: She's gone...

a9s: Damn! She got away.
cmd: Well, at least you're both safe.
cmd: That's an incredibly powerful unit you just faced.
a9s: That must be the gate Pascal opened for us.
cmd: You should probably keep your distance in the future.
n02: We have been expecting you.
a9s: Commander, why did A2 desert the force?
n02: Pascal told us about you.
cmd: ......
n02: We will open the gate.
cmd: I'm afraid that's classified.
n02: Please pass through.
a9s: Oh? Huh.
n02: We will continue to stand guard.
a9s: ...2B.
a2b: Yeah?
a9s: Let's go ask Pascal about A2.
a9s: He might know something.
a2b: All right.
a9s: Um, Pascal? This is 9S.
pascal: Oh! You survived! How wonderful.
a9s: Yeah, we're fine. But there's something we want to ask you about.
pascal: Of course! Anything.
a9s: Actually, it needs to be in person.
pascal: Hmm. Understood.
pascal: I'll open the gate we built to deter enemy invaders.
pascal: You'll be able to reach the village through there.

dbl: ......
op60: Operator to...2B!? 2B, are you all right!?
ppl: ......
a2b: Running system diagnostics... Core functionality appears intact.
dbl: Once you approach a target, the scanner can make it visible.
op60: Thank goodness!
resiman: Sorry, this terminal is out-of-order right now.
a2b: Never mind that—I need a status report.
