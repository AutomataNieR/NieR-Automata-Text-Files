"......"<bt_wait>
A dusty wind kisses my cheeks.<bt_wait>

Buried in sand, we press forward one step at a time.
We have nowhere else to go, after all.<bt_wait>
Because our models—the Devola and Popola models—are defective.

When first we woke, there were still people.<bt_wait>
They had flesh. Egos. Emotions. Souls. And they issued us a single order:

<i>Function as observers of Project Gestalt.</i><bt_wait>

This is the sole mission of the twin Devola and Popola models.<bt_wait>
It is the only reason we exist at all.
</page>

<page>
We were the latest model, though many companions shared our appearance.<bt_wait>

There was a sparkle in all of our eyes. A sense of pride at having been
entrusted with humanity's future.<bt_wait>

And yes, there was anxiety as well.<bt_wait>
But we existed as a pair. We shared destiny's burden as a pair.
And because of that, all hesitation was swept away.
</page>

<page>
Each pair was given their own cities as observation areas.
We were ordered to guide the Replicants with our own hands.
All for the sake of the “promised time” that would one day arrive.<bt_wait>

We were the only ones who could handle such a duty.
We were observers, after all.

"Ah!"<bt_wait>
"Watch out!"<bt_wait>
Devola staggers and falls in the soft yet unforgiving sand.
I hurry to her side and sigh with relief when I find she's not seriously hurt.<bt_wait>
“Are you all right?”<bt_wait>
“Sorry, Sis. Guess I spaced out there for a bit.”<bt_wait>

She smiles—the same wry smile I know so well—as she rubs absently at her leg.
It is wrapped in a white bandage.
</page>

<page>
“Your bandage is coming undone. Here, let me change it.”<bt_wait>
“It's all right, Popola. Come on—we have to go before we lose the light.”<bt_wait>
“We won't be going anywhere if sand gets into that thing.
Now quit whining and hold still. I'll be quick.”<bt_wait>

Devola grunts and turns away.<bt_wait> I take it as consent.<bt_wait>
Soon we are resting in the shade of a nearby rock as I pull the bandage free.
</page>

<page>
Artificial skin—torn and bloodied—peeks out from beneath the bandage.
Judging by Devola's current lack of ambulatory control,
I imagine the circuitry underneath has been damaged as well.<bt_wait>
