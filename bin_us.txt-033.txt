a9s: And wait, they have genders?
a9s: Um...
a9s: Hello. Do you know of a machine named <SARU_JAN> who lives in the village?
robogirl: Master <SARU_JAN> is quite the mysterious gentleman. One might even go so far as to call him suspicious. And yet he's so alluring all the same!
a2b: Suspicious...and alluring?
robogirl: Exactly. And I know just the gift for someone of that description!
robogirl: You'll deliver it to him straightaway, won't you?
robogirl: I won't let that terrible girl in the desert find a way to interfere with our love!
a9s: Hello there.
robogirl: Ack!
a9s: Huh?
robogirl: You came here from Master <SARU_JAN>'s village, didn't you?
robogirl: I can tell. I can smell him on you. *sniiiiiiiiff* Ahhhhh!
a9s: Okay. That's weird.
robogirl: <SARU_JAN> is wonderful. He pursues new knowledge with a passion that is almost indescribable. I admire him as I do no other.
a2b: You have issues.
robogirl: And YOU clearly lack a discerning eye. I bet men take advantage of you all the time.
a2b: Not exactly.
robogirl: Ah, right.
robogirl: I found something that Master <SARU_JAN> is sure to be interested in. Please take it to him with all speed!
a9s: Hey, 2B? I've been thinking about something.
a2b: What?
a9s: Do you think this <SARU_JAN> fellow is being a little too...I dunno. Glorified?
a2b: That's certainly one way to put it...
a9s: Hello?
sarutoru: Ah, yes. I see.
sarutoru: Dreams are the mind's version of reality perfected.
a9s: Hey, <SARU_JAN>? We have a delivery for you.
sarutoru: Ah! Allow me to see it at once.
sarutoru: Interesting. A letter, is it?
a2b: A female machine asked us to deliver it to you.
a2b: She said she could rely on you, and that you know pretty much everything.
sarutoru: Yes, yes. Now if I may, do you believe that existence precedes essence?
a9s: Um, is this about the letter?
sarutoru: No.
a9s: Right, but shouldn't you maybe respond to the letter?
sarutoru: Is one duty-bound to reply to every question spewed in their direction?
sarutoru: If such is your claim, then what power was it who placed this burdensome yoke about my neck?
a2b: This is a waste of time.
a9s: You got that right.
a9s: Hello, <SARU_JAN>. Do you have a moment?
sarutoru: Moments are transitory. One cannot possess them.
sarutoru: A moment passed is a moment lost; a symbol of idle, unrestrained apathy that—
a9s: I have another gift for you...
a9s: Can you please just take this present already?
sarutoru: A gift? Let me see.
a9s: Here you go.
sarutoru: Ah, yes. Fascinating...
a2b: The machine who gave this to us said you were both "suspicious" and "alluring."
sarutoru: It seems this so-called "gift" is nothing more than a piece of unadorned glass. Therefore, I can only surmise that—
a9s: Um, do you want us to bring a message back to the woman who gave this to you?
sarutoru: For a mere trifle? No.
a9s: Okay then.
a2b: Let's go.
sarutoru: Indeed, is there any purpose or need to the objects we find in the world? Consider, if you will, this place. Or this village. Or even myself, if such a—
a2b: I have another present for you...
a2b: We're here with a present for you.
sarutoru: A present? Of what sort?
a9s: It's a fossil. One of your followers asked us to deliver it to you.
sarutoru: I see, I see.
a2b: She said you were "indescribably passionate" when it came to learning. Or something like that.
sarutoru: A mechanical fossil. No use at all.
a9s: Do you want us to tell her anything on your behalf, or...
sarutoru: I'll not waste words on mere junk.
a9s: Junk!?
a2b: ......
a9s: <SARU_JAN> doesn't seem to appreciate these presents he's getting.
a9s: I suppose we should go tell his followers exactly what he thinks of them, huh?
a9s: They'll be waiting for some kind of reply.
robogirl: There you are! Well? What did the master have to say about my letter?
a9s: Actually, he said it wasn't worthy of a response.
robogirl: I KNEW it! Isn't he the greatest? I can't get enough of him.
a9s: You don't say...
robogirl: Did you give my gift to Master <SARU_JAN>?
robogirl: I must know what he said!
a9s: Well, he said it was a mere trifle.
robogirl: Such insight! Such truth! He sees to the core of things in a way others cannot!
robogirl: I shall follow you for the rest of my days, Master <SARU_JAN>!
a9s: That's a long time.
robogirl: You there! Delivery boy! Pray tell what Master <SARU_JAN> thought of my present.
a9s: He called it a useless piece of junk.
robogirl: Such cruelty! I've barely the words for it!
robogirl: When I think about his wanton sadism, it makes me... Oooooooh.
a9s: ......
a9s: This is exhausting.
a9s: <SARU_JAN> doesn't care at all about anyone but himself...
a9s: And yet his followers just keep talking about how great he is!
a9s: What's the point of all this? And what's he even getting out of it?
a2b: Maybe you should ask him.
a9s: Hmm? Where's <SARU_JAN>?
n02: Oh, hey. You again.
n02: If you're looking for <SARU_JAN>, you're too late.
robogirl: I won't let those other women beat me to the punch—\nI must write Master <SARU_JAN> a new letter at once!
n02: He set out on "a journey."
robogirl: Oh, Master <SARU_JAN>... What must I do to claim your attentions...?
a9s: A journey, huh?
robogirl: You seem quite friendly with Master <SARU_JAN>...\nSee that you don't steal him away from me!
n02: Yes. He said he needed to go find himself or...something.
n02: Oh, but he left a letter for you. Here.
a9s: Well, he's nothing if not consistent. A weirdo right to the very end...
