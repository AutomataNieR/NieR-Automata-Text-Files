n02: I really respect Pascal, you know?
n02: I mean, he's the one who thought to build this village for us outcasts.
n02: I really need to show him how thankful I am!
n02: If ooooonly there were some way to thank him...\nSooooome way...
sele: Stick around and hear him out.
sele: Leave before you get dragged into something.
a2: Yeah, yeah. I can take the hint.
n02: No hint! I just want to show Pascal how appreciated he is.
n02: Anyway, I was thinking he might like a new philosophy book.\nI hear they have such things over in the Resistance camp...
sele: Agree to get the book.
sele: Tell the machine to get bent.
a2: All right, I'll get your book. I owe that little clunker a favor or two anyway.
n02: Oh, that's wonderful!
n02: Apparently someone named "Anemone" has a large collection of such books, so you just need to go steal one!
a2: Uh, yeah, no. I think there's a better way.
ane: Pascal wants books on philosophy?
ane: Well, as it happens, I just finished this one the other day.
ane: You're welcome to take it if you like.
a2: Thanks.
ane: Could you give him this gold ore as well? He's been asking for this for a while, and I finally managed to get my hands on some.
a2: All right.
ane: It seems...odd that a machine lifeform would be into philosophy, don't you think?
ane: It makes me wonder how much we really know about our enemy...
a2: I wonder.

a9s: Hey, 2B. I was waiting for you.
a9s: I needed to give you this.
a9s: Say, 2B?
a9s: ......
a9s: No, never mind. Just be careful.
pod042: Planning preparations complete.
pod042: Confirm equipment delivered to quarters.
a9s: Before I could convince myself to tell 2B the truth...
a9s: our final major operation had begun.
a9s: Still, at the time, I knew nothing.
a9s: Not how the battle would end...
a9s: Nor what fate stood in wait for us.

pod153: Query: Why does this Tower possess an entrance at all?
pod153: All material transport takes place via aerial vehicles.
pod153: It is irrational for an infiltration route to be so easily accessible.
pod153: Hypothesis: Entrance is a trap.
a9s: I don't care.
a9s: I just have to kill them all.

a2: This tower is a giant cannon that's aimed at the human server on the moon.
a2: ......
a2: If we don't do something, all of humanity's remaining data will be destroyed.
a9s: Ha ha ha...ha ha ha hah!
a9s: So what?
a9s: None of it matters.
a9s: Or didn't you know?
a9s: We aren't required in this world anymore.
a9s: Humanity is extinct.
a9s: That moon server you're so worried about was invented to give us androids something to fight for.
a9s: And YoRHa was created to perpetuate the lie.
a9s: But in order to make sure no one ever learned the truth, we were DESIGNED to be killed.
a9s: They built a back door in the Bunker and programmed it to activate after a certain amount of time.
a9s: The Commander? Me? 2B?
a9s: Sacrificial lambs. All of us.
a9s: Isn't that HILARIOUS!? Doesn't it make you LAUGH!?

a9s: Shut up!
a9s: You killed 2B.
a9s: That's all we need to kill each other.
a2: ......
a2: 2B hated to keep killing you.
a2: It caused her so much pain.
a9s: ......
a2: The 9S type is a high-end model. They knew you'd discover the truth eventually.
a2: But the model designation "2B" was just a cover.
