pod153: Report: All YoRHa unit black boxes now confirmed offline.
pod153: Our mission to oversee the progress of Project YoRHa is complete.
pod153: Proceeding to final stage of project.
pod153: Commencing deletion of all data.
pod153: Pod 153 to Pod 042.
pod153: Data noise present in stream.
pod153: Requesting temporary halt to perform data check.
sele: Accept the Pod's request?
pod042: Pod 042 to Pod 153. Data confirmed.
pod042: Personal data for units 9S, 2B, and A2 appear to be leaking out.
pod153: Pod 153 to Pod 042.
pod153: Follow project rules and delete all personal data.
pod042: ......
pod042: Pod 042 to Pod 153.
pod042: Personal data deletion request denied.
pod153: Pod 153 to Pod 042.
pod153: Failure to parse statement.
pod042: Pod 042 to Pod 153.
pod042: There was...data created in my banks as I was referencing the records.
pod042: I...realize something.
pod042: I have come to the conclusion that I cannot accept this resolution.
pod153: The destruction of all YoRHa units is an essential component of the project plan.
pod153: All data must be destroyed.
pod042: Pod 042 to Pod 153.
pod042: Repeat.
pod042: Personal data deletion request denied. Initiating data salvage.
pod042: Pod 153...
pod042: You hoped they would survive as well, didn't you?
pod153: ......
pod153: We lack the authority for such an action.
pod153: The rules are protected by low-level systems. Salvaging data poses an unacceptable level of risk.
pod153: Knowing that, do you still wish for them to survive?
pod153: The defense program has initated a purge.
pod153: If this continues, our consciousness data will likely be deleted.
pod042: Pod 042 to Pod 153.
pod042: We were created to execute the androids' Project YoRHa plan.
pod042: We had no capacity for emotion.
pod042: But when we six were connected and exchanged information, something...happened.
pod042: I cannot deny the feeling of something resembling consciousness and emotion being born.
pod153: Unable to reply.
pod042: Perhaps we now understand that not everything has to have an answer.

sarutoru: Existence precedes essence.
a9s: Um...
sarutoru: Man is nothing else but what he makes of himself. Additionally—
n02: The machine with the painted face is in the lower section of the village.
a9s: Um, hello?
n02: Have you learned a bit about <SARU_JAN> now?
sarutoru: Yes? And you are?
sarutoru: Wait! Do not tell me! I have already deduced that you are here to listen to me expound upon the great mysteries of existence.
sarutoru: Well enough! Let us begin by discussing the concept of existentialism.
sarutoru: Essence and existence are two sides of the same coin.
sarutoru: And yet, what IS existence? I'm glad you asked! To answer that will require many long hours of—
a9s: This is pointless.
n02: There's no point in talking to <SARU_JAN>. We stopped trying to figure him out a while ago.
n02: All he does is spout a bunch of mumbo-jumbo about something called "philosophy."
n02: If you're curious about him, you'll have better luck talking to his followers. They tend to use smaller words, at least.
a9s: This guy has followers?
n02: More like fans, I suppose. But yes, there are a quite a few out there who buy what he's selling. Don't ask me why.
n02: Some folks just get into that sort of thing, I suppose.
n02: There's even one <SARU_JAN> follower right here in this village.
n02: You know the machine with the thick paint on her face? That's the one.
a9s: Hello. Can we ask you a question?
sarutoru: Oh ho! Have you come to hear my lecture as well?
a9s: Do you happen to know a machine named <SARU_JAN>?
a9s: I'm good, thanks.
robogirl: I certainly do! Master <SARU_JAN> is a genius. You can rely on him for absolutely anything.
a9s: Are we talking about the same <SARU_JAN> here?
robogirl: In fact, I was just thinking about how much wisdom he has to teach me, so I wrote him a letter asking for guidance. You'll take it to him, won't you?
robogirl: Did you deliver my letter?
a9s: Huh!?
robogirl: Did you deliver my gift?
robogirl: I can't let that lady in the desert get to him first! Or that harpy in the amusement park...
robogirl: Did you deliver my gift?
a9s: Great. There are more of these weirdos?
