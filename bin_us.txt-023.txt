a2b: Pod, report our status to Command!
pod042: Alert: All communications are currently being jammed.
a2b: God damn it!
a9s: 2B!
a9s: I located the unit that's jamming our comms.
a2b: Got it.
a9s: The jamming is coming from that thing!
a9s: That should take care of the jamming.
a2b: Pod, send an emergency distress signal to Command!
pod042: ......
a2b: Pod!
pod042: Alert: Connection lost. Unable to reach Command.
a2b: Damn it, they're STILL jamming us?
pod042: Negative. Signal reception is clear.
pod042: Connection lost due to server-side authentication failure.
pod042: No responses coming from Command on any channel.
a2b: Shit. What happened to the Bunker?
a2b: I can't keep doing this forever!
a9s: 2B! I have an idea!
a9s: It's possible to access the Bunker through a backdoor in the system.
a9s: I can use that to initiate an emergency upload of our personal log data.
a9s: Then we set our black boxes to self-destruct and take 'em all out at once!
a2b: ...Sounds good!
a9s: Data upload 30 percent complete.
a9s: 50 percent complete!
a9s: We just hit 70 percent!
a2b: Are you done yet!?
a9s: Almost! We're at 92 percent!
a9s: 2B! Your black box!

a2: What the hell?
a2: The machines are...eating each other!?
a2: Pod, where's Pascal!?
pod042: Unknown. Cannot establish connection.
pascal: Aaaah! A2!
a2: What happened!?
pascal: I don't know.
pascal: Some of the villagers suddenly went mad.
pascal: They began attacking their friends.
pascal: I managed to help the children flee to safety.
pascal: But I fear everyone else is...
a2: You need to get out of here before you're next.
a2: Just go. Run! I'll figure out how to handle this!
pascal: But what about you?
a2: These guys can't touch me.
a2: Now move your ass!
pascal: R-Right!
a2: I can't leave this village to fend for itself.
a2: Is that all of them?
a2: Pod, scan for survivors.
pod042: Scanning. No life signs detected.
a2: None, huh...?
a2: Pascal, can you hear me?
pascal: Ah! A2!
pascal: How is my village? My people?
a2: I'm sorry. I couldn't help them.
pascal: Oh no....
a2: Are the children all right?
pascal: I've taken them to the abandoned factory.
a2: All right. I'm on my way.

op210: ...And those are your orders. Do you understand?
op210: The target is thought to be in a high location with good network reception. Try examining the rooftops of buildings.
a9s: Um...
a9s: Roger.
a9s: The Scanners are going to hack into the enemy's anti-air system and shut it down in advance of an all-out assault, right?
op210: Please refrain from destroying the target. If you do, another one will simply take its place.
op210: That's right. Good job, 9S!
a9s: No killing the target. Got it.
a9s: Why are you talking to me like I'm a child?
op210: Be advised, the target's appearance is identical to that of a standard enemy. Once you approach, however, a marker will appear.
op210: What? That must be your imagination.
a9s: Is it me, or does it seem like they're getting smarter?
op210: Look for machines that are receiving signals from the anti-air system.
op210: Hmph! You destroyed it again.
op210: They should be located in elevated areas with good signal reception.
op210: You have to hack 'em! Hack-hack-hack!\nThey'll substitute another enemy soon, so try again.
op210: I've forwarded the general positions of the machine lifeforms you need to hack.
a9s: Roger.
a9s: Got it.
a9s: Whoops!
op210: I see your hacking was successful. Way to go!
op210: Unit 9S, your orders are to hack in to enemy units, not destroy them.
a9s: You're totally treating me like a kid.
