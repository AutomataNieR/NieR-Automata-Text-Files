a9s: 2B, we picked up the signal under the caved-in area.\nLet's go check it out.
pod042: Analysis: Strong software locks detected. Access impossible.
[[ph2\p200\p200_2fb68036_scp.bin]]
a9s: I must have been corrupted when Eve detached from the network...
a2b: No...
a9s: It's okay. I can always reload my backup data from the Bunker.
a2b: But you'll lose you. The you that exists at this very moment.
a9s: Guess so...
a9s: But we can't upload this corrupted data to the Bunker, so...
a2b: 9S...
[[ph2\p200\p200_3456f87_scp.bin]]
a2b: Protecting unit 9S while he hacks the system!
pod042: The enemy is connected to a vast network.
pod042: Analysis: The actions of unit 9S have an unacceptably low probability of success.
pod042: Proposal: Unit 2B should abandon unit 9S and save—
a2b: Shut up!
a2b: If 9S says he can do it, then he will!
pod042: Enemy unit cut off from network functionality.
[[ph2\p200\p200_398cde2c_scp.bin]]
ane: Damn... 9S really went through hell.
ane: But you're the boss. You want him sent up to Command body and all, I'll make it happen.
a2b: Thanks...
ane: Oh!
a2b: What?
ane: Nothing, just...you've never been much for gratitude, you know?
a2b: ......
ane: Not that I mind or anything.
ane: Oh, um, I also have a message for you.
ane: Command needs you to contact them ASAP.
a2b: Got it.
a2b: This is 2B. Patch me through to the Commander.
op60: Oh, hey, 2B. Roger that.
op60: Gimme just a second here...
cmd: 2B.
cmd: Good job destroying that machine.
cmd: Upon further analysis, we learned that the machine—code named Adam—was responsible for managing half of their entire network.
cmd: A disruption of this magnitude to their network should weaken the machines significantly.
a2b: What's going to happen to 9S?
cmd: He'll undergo a full data overhaul up here.
cmd: Assuming we don't encounter any problems, we're planning to partner him with you again.
a2b: Thank you.
cmd: In the meantime, I have another mission for you.
cmd: I've mailed you the briefing. Go ahead and take a look.
a2b: Understood.
a2b: "Analyze current trends among the machines?" ...Huh.
a2b: Something tells me this is going to involve a lot of killing.
pod042: Proposal: Procure information from the machine lifeform known as Pascal.
a2b: Hmm. I suppose he might know something.
a2b: Pascal? Can you hear me?
pascal: Oh, hello, 2B. Do you need something?
a2b: I need to know if you've seen any new trends or behaviors among the machines.
pascal: New...trends? Hmm...
pascal: Well, two days ago I was contacted by some machines that disconnected themselves from the network.
pascal: They wanted to discuss a peace treaty.
a2b: No kidding.
pascal: Apparently, they're seeking to form an alliance of some kind with our village.
a2b: If that's what they want, why don't they move in?
pascal: I believe they're working on building a colony of their own.
a2b: You don't say.
pascal: Indeed. Apparently, it's located in the abandoned factory.
pascal: I can give you the coordinates if you'd like.
a2b: Please.
pascal: I was actually planning to go speak with them myself, you know.
pascal: Maybe we can meet up over there?
a2b: Sounds good.
pascal: Oh, 2B! Hello!
pascal: Are you ready to go?
pod042: Report: Mail notification received from access point.
pod042: Target location data obtained. Marking on map.

kdc: Aim for the enemy androids!
kdc: Engage battle mode!
kdc: Now fight for your king!
all: For the king!
a9s: Here they come...
a9s: Better keep your guard up!
a2b: I'm aware of how to fight.
a2b: You just be careful.
a9s: I will, 2B!
a2b: These machines...
a9s: They were talking about a king, right?
a9s: I saw what looked to be a castle further in. Maybe we should take a look.
a9s: So those machines had a king?
a9s: But how can a concept like loyalty be understood by a machine?
a9s: How are we supposed to reach that castle?
n02: We must protect our king and kingdom!
n02: We will protect them!
n02: We must show our foes what we royal knights are made of!
n02: We will show them!
n02: We must fulfill our obligation to the king!
n02: We will fulfill!
n02: Er...but what is an "obligation"?
n02: But what is it!?
a9s: Looks like the freakshow's in town...
n02: No falling back! Fight!
n02: You have lived your whole life for this singular moment!
n02: For the Forest King!
n02: The Forest King!
a2b: What is with these guys...
a9s: Don't listen to what they're saying, 2B.
