pascal: Help, A2! The village is in great trouble!
pascal: The villagers are— Oh, no...!
a2: Pascal? Pascal, are you there!?
a2: What the hell is going on!?
pod042: Hypothesis: The valuable source of information known as Pascal has encountered difficulty.
pod042: Proposal: Unit A2 should investigate Pascal's village immediately.
a2: I'm on my way!
pod042: Proposal: Unit A2 should investigate the status of Pascal's village immediately.
a2: I know.

a2: You're useless.

pod153: Action must be taken immediately.

a9s: It doesn't matter. None of this matters!
a2: 9S...
a9s: But if it doesn't matter...why do I long for humans like this!?
a9s: Why do I desire the touch of something that no longer exists!?
a2: It's how we were made.
a2: Androids were designed to protect their human masters.
a2: Our core programming demands that we—
a9s: Shut up, shut up, shut UP, SHUT UP!
a9s: Fine then... I'll just destroy it!
a9s: Hee hee... If it all goes away, that'll solve everything!
a2: Damn it!

a9s: I'm in...the Resistance camp?
ppl: That's right. You've been unconscious for nearly two weeks.
dbl: A little thank-you for saving your butt would be nice!
a9s: Where's 2B?
ppl: ......
dbl: You know that better than anyone, no?
dbl: Her black box signal...disappeared.
a9s: ...Oh.
pod153: Devola and Popola are rare android models designed for medical treatment and maintenance.
pod153: Without the Bunker, they are the only remaining way for unit 9S to initiate repairs.
pod153: Proposal: A word of appreciation is appropriate.
a9s: ......
a9s: ...Thanks.
dbl: Yeah, there used to be lots of our models around.
dbl: Apparently, we were put here to oversee some kind of large-scale system that was in place.
a9s: Apparently? What does that mean?
dbl: It means we don't know. All the records from that era have been deleted.
dbl: Our model kinda went nutso at some point in the past. It ended badly.
ppl: Most of our kind were disposed of after that.
ppl: But we were spared.
ppl: They used us as a sort of control group in order to ensure such a thing couldn't happen again.
dbl: So yeah, we're lab rats. But at least we get to be here helping out friends.
dbl: I'd like to think that we're atoning in some way for our past sins.
a9s: ......
ppl: Try not to overdo it, 9S.

a9s: Is this entire building made of machines, even on the inside?
pod153: Analysis: Many useless parts unrelated to machine lifeform functionality detected.
pod153: The reason for using said parts is unknown.
a9s: There's no meaning to anything they do.
a9s: Is this writing?
a9s: I can't read it.
pod153: Analysis: Writing is an ancient language known as Angelic.
pod153: It reads "meat box."
a9s: Oooo-kay then.

a9s: Machines can't feel pain.
