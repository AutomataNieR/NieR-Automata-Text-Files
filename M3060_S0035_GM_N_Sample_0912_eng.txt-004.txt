[Record of Project Gestalt's End]





</page>

<page>
One day, our role as observers suddenly ended when Project Gestalt collapsed.
All due to the actions of Devola and Popola models from another town.<bt_wait>

With the original Gestalt lost, humanity was 
doomed<bt_wait>   cursed<bt_wait>   damned<bt_wait>   fated
to an inevitable extinction.<bt_wait>
We gathered what remaining Replicant data we could find and launched it
to   the   surface   of   the   moon.<bt_wait>
And though success was as unlikely as finding a lost sand grain in the desert,
we still had to attempt it. We still had to try.<bt_wait>
We were androids, you see. Protecting humanity<bt_wait> was our instinct.
</page>

<page>
Other androids, beholden to that same instinct, began to direct their hate
at all the remaining Devola and Popola models.<bt_wait>
We'd done it, after all.<bt_wait>
We destroyed Project Gestalt.<bt_wait>
We snuffed out the last hope of humanity.<bt_wait>

It started small. A few off-hand remarks. The occasional glance.<bt_wait>
But even the smallest things have weight, and with enough of them combined,
that weight eventually becomes a boulder.<bt_wait>
Emotions boiled over. Remarks became jeers. And soon enough,
my sister and I were hated.<bt_wait> Persecuted.<bt_wait> ...Outcasts.
</page>

<page>
At first, we simply accepted the fact that our friends turned on us.<bt_wait>

It was almost unavoidable, I suppose.<bt_wait>
We were observers for Project Gestalt, after all.
And while we didn't cause it to fail, the people who did...<bt_wait>
Well, they looked just like us.<bt_wait>

So we accepted it. We took the resentment and scorn. We endured.<bt_wait>
Because as crazy as it sounds, I think we actually felt...<bt_wait>responsible.
</page>

<page>
We moved from town to town in an effort to avoid persecution.
But in one such town, my seemingly infinite patience finally broke.<bt_wait>
My sister, Devola, met with unspeakable violence at the hands of the Resistance.
She said something in response to their taunts.<bt_wait> Something quiet.<bt_wait>
And though her words were ambiguous, they slashed her leg nearly in two.<bt_wait>

My vision narrowed. Everything went red. And then...she smiled at me.<bt_wait>
<i>It's okay, Sis. There's nothing we can do.</i><bt_wait>
But it was too late. My emotions were no longer in my control.<bt_wait>
I'm simply not strong enough to stand aside and let the most important person
in the world to me come to harm.
</page>

<page>
Devola and I left town that day.
Violence like that wouldn't stop. It was going to happen again.<bt_wait>
And again.<bt_wait>      And again.<bt_wait>      And again.<bt_wait>
And it wouldn't stop with just one of us either.<bt_wait>

So rather than let them kill us, we ran.
I guess it was the greatest resistance I could muster.

...Desert Part 4
*Show desert image D (wide desert area again)

<page>
We lose the sun as dark clouds gather overhead.
We continue our march.<bt_wait>

A cold wind blasts us, stealing what little body heat we have left.
I smell rain on the air.
We continue our march.<bt_wait>

Sometimes we hear animals howling in the distance.
It makes us flinch every time.
But we continue our march, because even this is better
than suffering at the hands of our friends.
</page>

<page>
Why are we persecuted so?<bt_wait> Why must we suffer?<bt_wait>
I know we're the same model as the androids who doomed humanity,
so I understand that part. At least a little, anyway.<bt_wait>
