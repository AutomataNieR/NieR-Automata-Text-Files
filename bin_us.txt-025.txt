op: It's do or die from now on. Good luck.
op: You were so cool! Tell me about everything that happened, okay? Leave no detail unspoken!
op: I'm gonna start a 2B fan club!
op: I'm sorry I was so cold earlier—I clearly misjudged you. Thank you for taking care of Eve.
op: I can finally relax again. And it's all thanks to you and 9S!
op: We're doing much better thanks to you. Great job!
op: I know you'll keep doing great things.
op: I saw your battle with Eve. You have such amazing control over your body! ...I'm kinda jealous.
op: Do you think you might give me some tips sometime?
op: You and 9S are the talk of the Bunker. You were incredible!
op: We'll all be counting on you the next time some terrible machine thing tries to kill us all!
op: That last battle looked really tough, but you pulled through. It was mesmerizing!
op: Just so you know, you're quite popular with the operators! ...Er, but you didn't hear that from me.
op: Man, I was sweating in my seat during that whole fight! ...I was the one displaying Eve's remaining vitals, by the way. Hope it helped!
op: Now get back out there and keep not dying!
op: That was a spectacular victory!
op: Here's to your next victory!
op: Wow, 2B... That must have been tough.
op: Let's keep the winning streak going! Woooo!
op: I bet you'll get a sweet promotion after this. And even if you don't, please know that all of us are forever in your debt.
op: Thank you for everything.
op: Please don't talk to me when we're in the middle of a mission.
op: Oh, and good luck. We're all counting on you.
op: Please don't bug me when I'm working!
op: Just get out there, kick some machine ass, and come back safe!
op: Hurry and move out.
op: ......
op: Good luck.
op: ...Er, don't you think it's time to go?
op: Remember that any amazing combat data you collect dies with you, so be careful.
op: Try not to die out there.
op: Everyone's doing a great job!
op: Now please hurry up and get going.
op: I've already started working. Please let me concentrate.
op: ......
op: Ugh, you're such a pain! Here we go again...
op: Don't worry, I'll give you perfect support.
op: It's almost time to head out.
op: You should probably get to the hangar.
op: This is a REALLY bad time for a chat!
op: Oh, but good luck!
op: This is my first large-scale mission. But don't worry—I increased my memory just in case.
op: You can count on me to make things work from this end!
