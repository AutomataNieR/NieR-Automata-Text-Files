pod042: Proposal: Unit A2 should secure the safety of Pascal and the children immediately.
a2: What's the hurry?
pod042: Haste is predicated on data obtained from the recently restored cross-regional Pod network.
a2: Wait, there's more of you?
pod042: Affirmative.
pod042: Cross-regional data reveals a large number of machine lifeforms amassing around these ruins.
a2: What!?
a2: Pascal!
pascal: Aaaah! A2!
pod042: Alert: Enemy reinforcements are infiltrating the facility.
a2: I'll smash 'em before they can reach this room.
pascal: You...you must let me help you!
pascal: I will smash them up and kill them!

pascal: Hmm...
pascal: "Where the state ceaseth, there only commenceth the man who is not superfluous."
pascal: Mmmm. I see.
pascal: It seems this Nietzsche was quite the profound thinker.
pascal: Or perhaps he skipped right past profound and went straight to crazy instead.
pascal: Ah, well. Enough of that.
pascal: I'd best go see the world for myself instead of burying my head in books.
child: Uncle Pascal, Uncle Pascal! Play with us!
children: Yeah! Come on and play!
pascal: Well, look at you! Your speaking has improved so much.
pascal: But I fear you still haven't finished your studies, have you?
pascal: You promised to read and memorize that botanical field guide, remember?
child: But you'll play with us when we're done, right?
children: Yeah, promise us!
pascal: Of course I will! You have my word.
pascal: And Uncle Pascal would never lie and break his word.
pascal: Because children who lie grow up to be mean, evil machines!
child: Aaaaah!
children: Aaaaah!
pascal: Hmmm? What's that?
