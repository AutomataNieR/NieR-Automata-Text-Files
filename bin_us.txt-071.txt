sele: Help the mother.
sele: Refuse.
robomother: Rrrrgh! What am I supposed to DO!?
robomother: Get this door open and drag my good-for-nothing son out here this instant!
a9s: All right, all right! Sheesh...
a9s: Yep. That's an electronic lock, all right ...Um, hello in there? Hellooo?
robochild: ......
a9s: Your mother is worried about you. So how about you unlock the door and come out?
robochild: ......
a9s: Looks like he's ignoring me.
pod153: Proposal: Destroy the core to open the electronic lock.
a9s: That seems to be my only option.
a9s: ...Damn. That lock's stronger than I thought.
robochild: ......
robomother: Foolish child! I was worried sick about you! Why on earth did you barricade yourself in there!?
robochild: 'Cause I was scared.
robochild: Now that we're cut off from the network, I dunno what people are thinking.
robochild: They're like...monsters. It's scary!
robomother: Oh, my darling boy. It will be all right. Mommy loves you.
robochild: Waaaaaah! Mamaaaaa!
a9s: Um... So can I go now, or...
robomother: Oh! Yes, of course. Thank you for your help.
robomother: And take this. I insist.
robomother: I'll try to help my son deal with his fears better from now on.

robomother: Get this door open and drag my good-for-nothing son out here this instant!
a9s: ...Damn. That lock's stronger than I thought.
robomother: Wait! You're that kind android from before! I hate to admit this, but my son has locked himself inside again.
a9s: I figured he'd be over that by now.
robomother: He tried so hard. I know he did! But fear has gotten the better of him and... Well, here we are.
robomother: The lock is even stronger this time—without your aid, I'll probably be standing here forever!
sele: Help the mother.
sele: Refuse.
robomother: Fine then. I guess I'll just have to do it myself! ...Rrrrgh! Stupid lock!
robomother: Open this lock and get my son out here for me. Please!
a9s: Let me try hacking it open.
robochild: ......
robomother: You had me worried sick, young man! I can't believe you did this AGAIN!
robochild: I was scared.
robochild: See, after I left the house, I...started to like this one girl. I thought I was gonna short-circuit whenever I looked at her!
robochild: I never felt that before and it was... It was... It was SCARY!
robomother: There there. It's all right. Next time, we'll go see her together. All right?
robochild: 'Kay.
robomother: Thank you again. Truly.
robomother: I don't have much to give you, but I hope this makes up for some of your troubles.
robomother: Oh, and feel free to come visit my child anytime you like. He seems...fond of you.
a9s: That kid's got issues...
