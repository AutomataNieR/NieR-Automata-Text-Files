“My name...is 9S.“<bt_wait><BGM_BGM_M3060_S0910_N_0010>
“A newly manufactured Scanner model.”<bt_wait>
“January 30th, 11942.”<bt_wait>
“Rolled out at 4:25 AM, Bunker time.”<bt_wait>
“I will fight for humanity with all my strength.”<bt_wait>
“The pleasure is mine, Commander.”
</page>
<page>
I lie collapsed in a space of blinding white.<bt_wait>
The pain is...gone.<bt_wait>
The light envelops me.<bt_wait> It's so <i>warm</i>.
</page>
<page>
I was anxious.<bt_wait>
A soldier from the moment I was born, thrown into the world alone.<bt_wait>
Nothing to rely on.<bt_wait>
No God to believe in.<bt_wait>

I was alone.<bt_wait>
Tasked with infiltrating enemy territory to gather intelligence.<bt_wait>
In the fog.<bt_wait>
In the flames.<bt_wait>
Alone.

“My name's 9S. I'm here to provide support.”<bt_wait>

2B came off as being rather aloof. Cold, even.<bt_wait>
She must have wanted to distance herself from me.<bt_wait>
I guess she didn't want to be attached to someone she had to kill
again and again and again.<bt_wait>

But... I...
</page>
<page>
“Scanners like me mostly work alone. Scouting out enemy lines and all that?”<bt_wait>
“I don't usually get a partner. It's kind of fun!”<bt_wait>

I was so happy to be with someone.<bt_wait>

It was like I had a family.
</page>
<page>
My damage worsens.<bt_wait>
I start to lose my memories.<bt_wait><BGM_BGM_M3060_S0910_N_0020>
The space fills up with pure white light. 
It's like being buried in snow.<color_505050><bt_wait>

It's a little bit cold.<color_606060><bt_wait>
It's a little bit frightening.<color_707070><bt_wait>
Will my soul...disappear?
</page>
<page>
A dark fog clouds my vision.<bt_wait>
As it ebbs and flows in its slow, dreamlike way, it gradually takes human shape.<bt_wait>

It's the red girl.<bt_wait>

She slowly begins to speak.
</page>
<page>
This tower is a colossal cannon built to destroy the human server.<bt_wait>
Destroy the server...and rob the androids of their very foundation.
That was the plan devised by those girls.<bt_wait>

But they changed their mind.<bt_wait>
They saw us androids.<bt_wait> They saw Adam.<bt_wait> And Eve.<bt_wait>
They saw how we lived, considered the meaning of existence,
and came to a different conclusion.
</page>
<page>
This tower doesn't fire artillery.<bt_wait> It fires an <i>ark</i>.<bt_wait>
An ark containing memories of the foolish machine lifeforms.<bt_wait>
An ark that sends those memories to a new world.<bt_wait>

Perhaps they'll never reach that world.<bt_wait>
Perhaps they'll simply wander an empty sky for eternity.<bt_wait>
It's all the same to the girls. For them, time is without end.
</page>
<page>
Adam and Eve are inside the ark.<bt_wait>
Eve is asleep.<bt_wait>
Adam holds him in a gentle embrace. He seems to be smiling at me.<color_808080><bt_wait>

I try to look up at him, but my body refuses to move.<color_a0a0a0><bt_wait>
Looks like the damage has spread to my motor functions as well.
</page>
<page>
“Will you come with us?” asks Adam.<bt_wait>
The question was completely free of malice.<bt_wait>
It seemed I no longer had a reason to hate machines.<bt_wait>
Maybe I never had a reason in the first place.<bt_wait>

What have I been fighting for?<bt_wait>
Who have I been <i>living</i> for?<bt_wait>

I don't know anymore.
</page>
<page>
<color_b0b0b0>I try to speak my mind, but the words don't come out right.<color_c0c0c0><bt_wait>
My thought routines are losing cohesion.<bt_wait>
I don't...<bt_wait> I can't remember my name.<bt_wait>

“I'm...”
</page>

<page>
Mustering all my strength, I force out the words...<bt_wait>

<sele_YES> “I'll go with you.”
<sele_NO> “I'll stay.”
