It moved fast.<bt_wait> So fast.<bt_wait>
Like a wind.<bt_wait>

Popola and I would go to the observation room and act like it was all okay.
We'd talk to the Replicants as if we didn't have a care in the world.
But at night, we'd just hold each other and share the horror of it all.

“I'm glad you were with me,” murmurs Popola.
“I couldn't have handled being an observer all alone.”<bt_wait>
“We were able to endure because we had each other,” I reply softly.<bt_wait>

Did the humans see this coming? Is that why they made a twin model?<bt_wait>
Were they really so clever?<bt_wait> ...Were they really so cruel?<bt_wait>       
I couldn't have done this by myself. I would have descended into madness.
I simply couldn't bear such a burden all alone.

“When I get the chance, I'm going to try contacting another city,” she says.
Maybe these abnormalities are a localized phenomenon.”<bt_wait>
“I pray that's the case,” I reply. "Even if we're of no use ourselves,
things will still work out if the other observers can pull through.”<bt_wait>
“Don't worry. It's going to be okay.”<bt_wait>

But it wasn't okay.<bt_wait> Nothing was okay.<bt_wait>
All thanks to a pair of Devola and Popola models from another town.

The wind rubs my cheeks. The sand grazes my skin.<bt_wait>
It's grown cold out here.<bt_wait><BGM_BGM_M3060_S0035_N_0020>
We walk with renewed purpose, hoping to make up for lost time.
Devola loses her balance every now and then. It gets bad after a while.<bt_wait>
I slip myself under her arm so she won't fall again and we press on.<bt_wait>

“Is your leg all right?”<bt_wait>
“Well, I doubt I'll be dancing anytime soon, but yeah. It's fine.”<bt_wait>

She smiles as she says this, but I can tell she doesn't have much left.
And yet, she continues to smile—all so I won't worry.
</page>

<page>
I remember when our Resistance allies injured her leg.<bt_wait>
I was furious. Beyond fury. I wanted to scream and cry and lose myself in it.
But then she smiled, and all of that rage just...drifted away.<bt_wait>

To think we have the same face, yet such different smiles.<bt_wait>

One day, I realized how she reminded me of the martyrs I'd seen in old records.
That was the day we decided to leave our town forever.

[Record of Project Gestalt's End]





</page>

<page>
Our role as observers ended on the day Project Gestalt collapsed.
All due to the actions of Devola and Popola models from another town.<bt_wait>

With the original Gestalt lost, humanity was doomed to an inevitable extinction.<bt_wait>
Knowing this, we gathered what remaining Replicant data we could find
and launched it to the surface of the moon.<bt_wait>
And though success was as unlikely as finding a lost sand grain in the desert,
we still had to attempt it.<bt_wait> We still had to try.<bt_wait>
We were androids, you see. Protecting humanity was our instinct.
</page>

<page>
Other androids, beholden to that same instinct, began to direct their hate at
the Devola and Popola models who'd snuffed out humanity.<bt_wait>

It started small. A few off-hand remarks. The occasional glance.<bt_wait>
But even the smallest things have weight, and with enough of them combined,
that weight eventually becomes a boulder.<bt_wait>
Emotions boiled over. Remarks became jeers. And soon enough,
