a9s: It's open.
pod153: Alert: 2B is currently engaging a machine lifeform of significant ability.
pod153: Said machine is drawing electrical power from the factory itself.
pod153: Proposal: Infiltrate the factory's mainframe and shut off the power.
a9s: 2B! Keep going straight!
a2b: Will do.
a9s: The door's open! Keep moving!
a2b: All right.
a9s: Exit route secured!
a2b: Thanks!

a9s: Okay, good... 2B's black box signal is still up and running.
a9s: These comms are all messed up...
a9s: Guess I'll have to break in to the other side and take control.

eve: I... Brother, I...
eve: Oh, brother... Why...?

a9s: What is this?
pod153: Alert: Disruption detected in YoRHa unit 9S's self-consciousness data. Corruption potential critical.
pod153: Evacuation recommended.
a9s: Can't. Not when I'm this far in!
eve: My brother was everything to me...
eve: My life was contained in our moments...
pod153: Alert: Corruption confirmed in YoRHa unit 9S's self-consciousness data.
pod153: Immediate evacuation and treatment recommended.
a9s: Just...a little more...
a9s: If I can remove Eve's object control function...
eve: Listen to me, Adam...
eve: I never disliked fighting.
eve: But I didn't want you to be hurt.
eve: And I especially didn't want to lose you.
eve: So let's go somewhere quiet. Together.
eve: My brother...

a2: Where am I...?
pod042: The EMP attack appears to have caused hacking damage to unit A2's memory modules.
a2: Oh, so this is my memory area.
a2: But why are YOU here?
pod042: Support units are required to monitor our targets' internal systems in case of breakdown.
a2: Next time ask me before you go poking around in my head.
a2: Nnngh...
n02: I...am a...desert test unit...
n02: Created...wipe out mankind...
a2: What's all this about?
pod042: The hacking has caused the enemy's memories to merge with your own.
cmd: Normally, you'd be called...but...calling you 2B for the time...
cmd: Continue to observe the situation, and dispatch...if necessary.
pod042: This is a fragment of unit 2B's memory data.
pod042: It is an order she received from the YoRHa Commander when she was still alive.
n4: ... not right, Number Two. We're all here...... \nchose to be here...
n4: Thank... giving meaning to my life...
a2: Enough!
pod042: Memory data recognized as belonging to YoRHa unit A2 herself.
a2: Shut up and get out of my head already!

a9s: What's...this barrier?
pod153: Analysis: It is part of a closed defensive system.
a9s: Well, how do I break it down!?
pod153: Hypothesis: Unit 9S could permit his self-consciousness data to lose control.
pod153: The resulting energy surge has an acceptable probability of temporarily paralyzing the barrier.
a9s: That's almost as bad as not going in at all!
[[quest\qaeb\qaeb_98b8e891_scp.bin]]
a2: Damn it...
pod042: Alert: Enemy hacking detected.
pod042: Proposal: Retreat immediately.
a2: Who ARE you!?
girls: Good to see you again...Number Two.
girls: Or should we call you A2 now?
girls: This does bring back memories.
girls: Though to concepts like us, time has little meaning.
girls: Still, when we wiped out your forces, it made quite the impression on us.
girls: YoRHa attacker model Number Two...
girls: An experimental, disposable group created as a test run for Project YoRHa.
a2: Shut up!
girls: You're an obstinate little android, aren't you?
girls: Didn't we say that you can't kill us?
a2: God damn it!
